bibliography managed in bibtex with BibDesk and custom rdfa exporter templates

xml escaping snafus avoided by editing & and < symbols out of the text within BibDesk

raptor/redland or librdf bug:  http://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=289

Once bibdesk is built, it looks in somewhere like:

	/Users/danbri/Library/Application Support/Bibdesk/Templates

...for templates. My custom ones are here in bibdesk-templates/ dir. If you're lucky they'll emit
crude XHTML+RDFa but they are fragile.
