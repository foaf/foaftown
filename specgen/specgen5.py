# This is a draft rewrite of specgen, the family of scripts (originally
# in Ruby, then Python) that are used with the FOAF and SIOC RDF vocabularies.
# This version is a rewrite by danbri, begun after a conversion of 
# Uldis Bojars and Christopher Schmidt's specgen4.py to use rdflib instead of
# Redland's Python bindings. While it shares their goal of being independent
# of any particular RDF vocabulary, this first version's main purpose is 
# to get the FOAF spec workflow moving again. It doesn't work yet.
# 
# A much more literal conversion of specgen4.py to use rdflib can be 
# found, abandoned, in the old/ directory as 'specgen4b.py'.
