This directory can be used as a wrapper for the live foaf svn, which is held in a different svn server.

It links some files found there so that specgen can be run against this dir using:

		 ./specgen5.py foaf-live/ http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ foaf

If updating the real foaf site, you also need to take care of commiting and checking out appropriately.

The specgen filetree here is mainly for the software...

0.

this directory is specgen/foaf-live

for now, lets set it up such that it points to the svn checkout of the live foaf xmlns site:

 ln -s ~/working/foaf/trunk/xmlns.com/htdocs/foaf/0.1/template.html template.html
 ln -s ~/working/foaf/trunk/xmlns.com/htdocs/foaf/spec/index.rdf index.rdf
 ln -s ~/working/foaf/trunk/xmlns.com/htdocs/foaf/doc/ doc

Future revs of specgen.py could allow these pieces to be passed as individual parameters?

We will set it to read from the xmlns svn, generate our candiate spec here, ... and when we are happy with it, 
we copy files to their final home in the xmlns svn, commit and then refresh the live site.


1. make sure css file is in place

 cp style.css ~/working/foaf/trunk/xmlns.com/htdocs/foaf/spec/


Test copy of FOAF (for safe experiments) is done this way:

 ./specgen5.py examples/foaf/ http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ foaf

generates examples/foaf/_tmp_spec.html




2. check the archived versions of the last spec are in place (they should be)

this is in the xmlns svn

eg.
Namespace Document 2 November 2007 - OpenID Edition
This version:
   http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/20071002.html (rdf)
Latest version:
   http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/ (rdf)
Previous version:
   http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/20070524.html (rdf)

3a. update / edit the current live template, such that it has links to these and to its own anticipated 
permalinks for today's snapshot.

3b. generate a spec locally, using the linked xmlns svn files:

from ..

 ./specgen5.py foaf-live/ http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ foaf



3c. commit those edits to xmlns svn 


4. we will add an update to index.html and index.rdf as well as frozen copies of current version of each, using dated filenames
