<h2 id="sec-status">Abstract</h2>
<p>
This specification describes the FOAF language, defined as a dictionary of named 
properties and classes using W3C's RDF technology.  
</p>

  <div class="status">
    <h2>Status of This Document</h2>

    <p>
FOAF has been evolving gradually since its creation in mid-2000. There is now a stable core of classes and properties 
that will not be changed, beyond modest adjustments to their documentation to track 
implementation feedback and emerging best practices. New terms may be 
added at any time (as with a natural-language dictionary),  and consequently this specification 
is an evolving work. The FOAF RDF namespace, by contrast, is fixed and it's 
identifier is not expected to <a href="#sec-evolution">change</a>. Furthermore, efforts are 
underway to ensure the long-term preservation of the FOAF namespace, its xmlns.com 
domain name and associated documentation.
</p>


<p> This document is created by combining the <a href="index.rdf">RDFS/OWL</a> machine-readable
    FOAF ontology with a set of <a href="../doc/">per-term</a> documents. Future versions may 
    incorporate <a href="http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/foaf18n/">multilingual translations</a> of the 
    term definitions. The RDF version of the specification is also embedded in the HTML of this 
    document, or available directly from the namespace URI by content negotiation. 
</p>
<p>
    The FOAF specification is produced as part of the <a href=
    "http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF project</a>, to provide
    authoritative documentation of the contents, status and purpose
    of the RDF/XML vocabulary and document formats known informally
    as 'FOAF'.</p>

    <p>The authors welcome comments on this document, preferably via the public FOAF developers list <a href=
    "mailto:foaf-dev@lists.foaf-project.org">foaf-dev@lists.foaf-project.org</a>;
    <a href="http://lists.foaf-project.org">public archives</a> are
    available. A historical backlog of known technical issues is acknowledged, and available for discussion in the 
    <a href="http://wiki.foaf-project.org/IssueTracker">FOAF wiki</a>. Proposals for resolving these issues are welcomed, 
    either on foaf-dev or via the wiki. Further work is also needed on the explanatory text in this specification and on the 
    <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF website</a>; progress towards this will be measured in the version number of 
    future revisions to the FOAF specification.
   </p>

<p>This revision of the specification includes a first draft description of the new <a href="#term_openid">foaf:openid</a> property. 
The prose description of this property is likely to evolve, but the basic mechanism seems robust. To accompany this support for OpenID 
in the FOAF specification, the <a href="http://wiki.foaf-project.org/">FOAF wiki</a> has also been updated to support usage of OpenID 
by members of the developer community. This revision of the spec also involves a change in the DTD declared at the top of the document. 
This is a foundation for using inline <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a> markup in future versions. The current 
version however does not yet validate according to this document format; it contains RDF/XML markup describing FOAF in machine-readable 
form. We welcome feedback on whether to retain this markup at the expense of DTD-based validation.
</p>
<p>
As usual, see the <a href="#sec-changes">changes</a> section for details of the changes in this version of the specification.

  <p>This brief example introduces the basics of FOAF. It basically

  a <a href="#term_mbox_sha1sum">foaf:mbox_sha1sum</a> property of
  241021fb0e6289f92815fc210f9e9137262c252e; this person stands in a
  <a href="#term_homepage">foaf:homepage</a> relationship to a

 <h2 id="sec-intro">1 Introduction: FOAF Basics</h2>

  <h3 id="sec-sw">The Semantic Web</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
  To a computer, the Web is a flat, boring world, devoid of meaning. 
  This is a pity, as in fact documents on the Web describe real objects and 
  imaginary concepts, and give particular relationships between them. For 
  example, a document might describe a person. The title document to a house describes a house and also the ownership relation 
  with a person. Adding semantics to the Web involves two things: allowing documents which have information 
  in machine-readable forms, and allowing links to be created with relationship 
  values. Only  when we have this extra level of semantics will we be able to use computer power 
  to help us exploit the information to a greater extent than our own reading.
</em>
</p>
- Tim Berners-Lee &quot;W3 future directions&quot; keynote, 1st World Wide Web Conference Geneva, May 1994
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sec-foafsw">FOAF and the Semantic Web</h3>

<p>
FOAF, like the Web itself, is a linked information system. It is built using decentralised <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> technology, and has been designed to allow for integration of data across 
a variety of applications, Web sites and services, and software systems. To achieve this, FOAF takes a liberal approach to data 
exchange. It does not require you to say anything at all about yourself or others, nor does it place any limits on the things you can 
say or the variety of Semantic Web vocabularies you may use in doing so. This current specification provides a basic "dictionary" of 
terms for talking about people and the things they make and do.</p>

<p>FOAF was designed to be used alongside other such dictionaries ("schemas" or "ontologies"), and to beusable with the wide variety 
of generic tools and services that have been created for the Semantic Web. For example, the W3C work on <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> provides us with a rich query language for consulting databases of FOAF data, 
while the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a> initiative explores in more detail than FOAF the problem of describing 
topics, categories, "folksonomies" and subject hierarchies. Meanwhile, other W3C groups are working on improved mechanisms for encoding 
all kinds of RDF data (including but not limited to FOAF) within Web pages: see the work of the <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/grddl-wg/">GRDDL</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> efforts for more 
detail. The Semantic Web provides us with an <em>architecture for collaboration</em>, allowing complex technical challenges to be 
shared by a loosely-coordinated community of developers. 
</p>

  <p>The FOAF project is based around the use of <em>machine
  readable</em> Web homepages for people, groups, companies and
  other kinds of thing. To achieve this we use the "FOAF
  vocabulary" to provide a collection of basic terms that can be
  used in these Web pages. At the heart of the FOAF project is a
  set of definitions designed to serve as a dictionary of terms
  that can be used to express claims about the world. The initial
  focus of FOAF has been on the description of people, since people
  are the things that link together most of the other kinds of
  things we describe in the Web: they make documents, attend
  meetings, are depicted in photos, and so on.</p>

  <p>The FOAF Vocabulary definitions presented here are written
  using a computer language (RDF/OWL) that makes it easy for
  software to process some basic facts about the terms in the FOAF
  vocabulary, and consequently about the things described in FOAF
  documents. A FOAF document, unlike a traditional Web page, can be
  combined with other FOAF documents to create a unified database
  of information. FOAF is a <a 
  href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">Linked 
  Data</a> system, in that it based around the idea of linking together 
  a Web of decentralised descriptions.</p>


  <h3 id="sec-basicidea">The Basic Idea</h3>

  <p>The basic idea is pretty simple. If people publish information
  in the FOAF document format, machines will be able to make use of
  that information. If those files contain "see also" references to
  other such documents in the Web, we will have a machine-friendly
  version of today's hypertext Web. Computer programs will be able
  to scutter around a Web of documents designed for machines rather
  than humans, storing the information they find, keeping a list of
  "see also" pointers to other documents, checking digital
  signatures (for the security minded) and building Web pages and
  question-answering services based on the harvested documents.</p>

  <p>So, what is the 'FOAF document format'? FOAF files are just
  text documents (well, Unicode documents). They are written in XML
  syntax, and adopt the conventions of the Resource Description
  Framework (RDF). In addition, the FOAF vocabulary defines some
  useful constructs that can appear in FOAF files, alongside other
  RDF vocabularies defined elsewhere. For example, FOAF defines
  categories ('classes') such as <code>foaf:Person</code>,
  <code>foaf:Document</code>, <code>foaf:Image</code>, alongside
  some handy properties of those things, such as
  <code>foaf:name</code>, <code>foaf:mbox</code> (ie. an internet
  mailbox), <code>foaf:homepage</code> etc., as well as some useful
  kinds of relationship that hold between members of these
  categories. For example, one interesting relationship type is
  <code>foaf:depiction</code>. This relates something (eg. a
  <code>foaf:Person</code>) to a <code>foaf:Image</code>. The FOAF
  demos that feature photos and listings of 'who is in which
  picture' are based on software tools that parse RDF documents and
  make use of these properties.</p>

  <p>The specific contents of the FOAF vocabulary are detailed in
  this <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF namespace
  document</a>. In addition to the FOAF vocabulary, one of the most
  interesting features of a FOAF file is that it can contain "see
  Also" pointers to other FOAF files. This provides a basis for
  automatic harvesting tools to traverse a Web of interlinked
  files, and learn about new people, documents, services,
  data...</p>

  <p>The remainder of this specification describes how to publish
  and interpret descriptions such as these on the Web, using
  RDF/XML for syntax (file format) and terms from FOAF. It
  introduces a number of categories (RDF classes such as 'Person')
  and properties (relationship and attribute types such as 'mbox'
  or 'workplaceHomepage'). Each term definition is provided in both
  human and machine-readable form, hyperlinked for quick
  reference.</p>

  <h2 id="sec-for">What's FOAF for?</h2>

  <p>For a good general introduction to FOAF, see Edd Dumbill's
  article, <a href=
  "http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf.html">XML
  Watch: Finding friends with XML and RDF</a> (June 2002, IBM
  developerWorks). Information about the use of FOAF <a href=
  "http://rdfweb.org/2002/01/photo/">with image metadata</a> is
  also available.</p>

  <p>The <a href= "http://rdfweb.org/2002/01/photo/">co-depiction</a>
  experiment shows a fun use of the vocabulary. Jim Ley's <a href=
  "http://www.jibbering.com/svg/AnnotateImage.html">SVG image
  annotation tool</a> show the use of FOAF with detailed image
  metadata, and provide tools for labelling image regions within a
  Web browser. To create a FOAF document, you can use Leigh Dodd's
  <a href=

  <h2 id="sec-bg">Background</h2>

  <p>FOAF is a collaborative effort amongst Semantic Web
  developers on the FOAF (foaf-dev@lists.foaf-project.org) mailing
  list. The name 'FOAF' is derived from traditional internet usage,
  an acronym for 'Friend of a Friend'.</p>

  <p>The name was chosen to reflect our concern with social
  networks and the Web, urban myths, trust and connections. Other
  uses of the name continue, notably in the documentation and
  investigation of Urban Legends (eg. see the <a href=
  "http://www.urbanlegends.com/">alt.folklore.urban archive</a> or
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/">snopes.com</a>), and other FOAF
  stories. Our use of the name 'FOAF' for a Web vocabulary and
  document format is intended to complement, rather than replace,
  these prior uses. FOAF documents describe the characteristics and
  relationships amongst friends of friends, and their friends, and
  the stories they tell.</p>

  <h2 id="sec-standards">FOAF and Standards</h2>

  <p>It is important to understand that the FOAF
  <em>vocabulary</em> as specified in this document is not a
  standard in the sense of <a href=
  "http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/ISOOnline.openerpage">ISO
  Standardisation</a>, or that associated with <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">Process</a>.</p>

  <p>FOAF depends heavily on W3C's standards work, specifically on
  XML, XML Namespaces, RDF, and OWL. All FOAF <em>documents</em>
  must be well-formed RDF/XML documents. The FOAF vocabulary, by
  contrast, is managed more in the style of an <a href=
  "http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> or <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
  project than as an industry standardarisation effort (eg. see
  <a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0001.html">Jabber
  JEPs</a>).</p>

  <p>This specification contributes a vocabulary, "FOAF", to the
  Semantic Web, specifying it using W3C's <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework</a>
  (RDF). As such, FOAF adopts by reference both a syntax (using
  XML) a data model (RDF graphs) and a mathematically grounded
  definition for the rules that underpin the FOAF design.</p>

  <h2 id="sec-nsdoc">The FOAF Vocabulary Description</h2>

  <p>This specification serves as the FOAF "namespace document". As
  such it describes the FOAF vocabulary and the terms (<a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> classes and properties) that
  constitute it, so that <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> applications can
  use those terms in a variety of RDF-compatible document formats
  and applications.</p>

  <p>This document presents FOAF as a <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> vocabulary or
  <em>Ontology</em>. The FOAF vocabulary is pretty simple,
  pragmatic and designed to allow simultaneous deployment and
  extension. FOAF is intended for widescale use, but its authors
  make no commitments regarding its suitability for any particular
  purpose.</p>

  <h3 id="sec-evolution">Evolution and Extension of FOAF</h3>

  <p>The FOAF vocabulary is identified by the namespace URI
  '<code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</code>'. Revisions and
  extensions of FOAF are conducted through edits to this document,
  which by convention is accessible in the Web via the namespace URI.
  For practical and deployment reasons, note that <b>we do not 
  update the namespace URI as the vocabulary matures</b>.
  </p>
  <p>The core of FOAF now is considered stable, and the version number of 
  <em>this specification</em> reflects this stability. However, it 
  long ago became impractical to update the namespace URI without 
  causing huge disruption to both producers and consumers of FOAF 
  data. We are therefore left with the digits "0.1" in our URI. This 
  stands as a warning to all those who might embed metadata in their 
  vocabulary identifiers.
</p>

<p>
  The evolution of FOAF is best considered in terms of the
  stability of individual vocabulary terms, rather than the
  specification as a whole. As terms stabilise in usage and
  documentation, they progress through the categories
  '<strong>unstable</strong>', '<strong>testing</strong>' and
  '<strong>stable</strong>'.</p><!--STATUSINFO-->

  <p>The properties and types defined here provide some basic
  useful concepts for use in FOAF descriptions. Other vocabulary
  (eg. the <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>
  metadata elements for simple bibliographic description), RSS 1.0
  etc can also be mixed in with FOAF terms, as can local
  extensions. FOAF is designed to be extended. The <a href=
  "http://wiki.foaf-project.org/FoafVocab">FoafVocab</a> page in the
  FOAF wiki lists a number of extension vocabularies that are
  particularly applicable to use with FOAF.</p>

  <h2 id="sec-autodesc">FOAF Auto-Discovery: Publishing and Linking FOAF files</h2>

  <p>If you publish a FOAF self-description (eg. using <a href=
  "http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html">foaf-a-matic</a>)
  you can make it easier for tools to find your FOAF by putting
  markup in the <code>head</code> of your HTML homepage. It doesn't
  really matter what filename you choose for your FOAF document,
  although <code>foaf.rdf</code> is a common choice. The linking
  markup is as follows:</p>

  <div class="example">
<pre>
  &lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF"
               href="<em>http://example.com/~you/foaf.rdf</em>"/&gt;
</pre>
  </div>

  <p>...although of course change the <em>URL</em> to point to your
  own FOAF document. See also: more on <a href=
  "http://rdfweb.org/mt/foaflog/archives/000041.html">FOAF
  autodiscovery</a> and services that make use of it.</p>

  <h2 id="sec-foafandrdf">FOAF and RDF</h2>

  <p>Why does FOAF use <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>?</p>

  <p>FOAF is an application of the Resource Description Framework
  (RDF) because the subject area we're describing -- people -- has
  so many competing requirements that a standalone format could not
  do them all justice. By using RDF, FOAF gains a powerful
  extensibility mechanism, allowing FOAF-based descriptions can be
  mixed with claims made in <em>any other RDF vocabulary</em></p>

  <p>People are the things that link together most of the other
  kinds of things we describe in the Web: they make documents,
  attend meetings, are depicted in photos, and so on. Consequently,
  there are many many things that we might want to say about
  people, not to mention these related objects (ie. documents,
  photos, meetings etc).</p>

  <p>FOAF as a vocabulary cannot incorporate everything we might
  want to talk about that is related to people, or it would be as
  large as a full dictionary. Instead of covering all topics within
  FOAF itself, we buy into a larger framework - RDF - that allows
  us to take advantage of work elsewhere on more specific
  description vocabularies (eg. for geographical / mapping
  data).</p>

  <p>RDF provides FOAF with a way to mix together different
  descriptive vocabularies in a consistent way. Vocabularies can be
  created by different communites and groups as appropriate and
  mixed together as required, without needing any centralised
  agreement on how terms from different vocabularies can be written
  down in XML.</p>

  <p>This mixing happens in two ways: firstly, RDF provides an
  underlying model of (typed) objects and their attributes or
  relationships. <code>foaf:Person</code> is an example of a type
  of object (a "<em>class</em>"), while <code>foaf:knows</code> and
  <code>foaf:name</code> are examples of a relationship and an
  attribute of an <code>foaf:Person</code>; in RDF we call these
  "<em>properties</em>". Any vocabulary described in RDF shares
  this basic model, which is discernable in the syntax for RDF, and
  which removes one level of confusion in <em>understanding</em> a
  given vocabulary, making it simpler to comprehend and therefore
  reuse a vocabulary that you have not written yourself. This is
  the minimal <em>self-documentation</em> that RDF gives you.</p>

  <p>Secondly, there are mechanisms for saying which RDF properties
  are connected to which classes, and how different classes are
  related to each other, using RDF Syntax and OWL. These can be
  quite general (all RDF properties by default come from an
  <code>rdf:Resource</code> for example) or very specific and
  precise (for example by using <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/">OWL</a> constructs, as in the
  <code>foaf:Group</code> example below. This is another form of
  self-documentation, which allows you to connect different
  vocabularies together as you please. An example of this is given
  below where the <code>foaf:based_near</code> property has a
  domain and range (types of class at each end of the property)
  from a different namespace altogether.</p>

  <p>In summary then, RDF is self-documenting in ways which enable
  the creation and combination of vocabularies in a devolved
  manner. This is particularly important for a vocabulary which
  describes people, since people connect to many other domains of
  interest, which it would be impossible (as well as suboptimal)
  for a single group to describe adequately in non-geological
  time.</p>

  <p>RDF is usually written using XML syntax, but behaves in rather
  different ways to 'vanilla' XML: the same RDF can be written in
  many different ways in XML. This means that SAX and DOM XML
  parsers are not adequate to deal with RDF/XML. If you want to
  process the data, you will need to use one of the many RDF
  toolkits available, such as Jena (Java) or Redland (C). <a href=
  "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/">RDF
  Interest Group</a> members can help with issues which may arise;
  there is also the <a href=
  "http://rdfweb.org/mailman/listinfo/rdfweb-dev">rdfweb-dev@yapours.rdfweb.org</a>
  mailing list which is the main list for FOAF, and two active and
