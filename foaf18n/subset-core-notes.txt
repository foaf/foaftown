from Shadi re EARL:

we are using (dependency) foaf:Agent and foaf:Person, iwe also reference foaf:Organization, foaf:Group. Properties: mbox, sha1sum, and name
	unstable: foaf:Agent, foaf:Group, foaf:Org
	testing: name, sha1sum
	stable: Person, mbox
	stable: homepage (we also use that one)

 re EARL usage and need for a 'Software' class: looked at DOAP but 
 "it is too much project oriented rather than software (in terms of an agent)"

Note: we don't necessarily need foaf:Group and foaf:Org to be stable (but then we will not be able to have dependencies on these)

<!--
shadi:	we had assumed that both foaf:Org and foaf:Group are foaf:Agents
danbri:	i think they're declared as, but their own relationship was vague
shadi:  but that a foaf:Group could contain further foaf:Agents
danbri:	does saying "all organizations are groups" break anything for you?
shadi:  we have a similar construct for earl:Assertor
shadi:  no, it doesn't break anything
