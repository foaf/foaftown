Any idea what they are?

Almost certainly spam sent by people using "easy-to-use" spamming software
that they haven't bothered to read the instructions for. I get plenty
addressed to things like "To: %%emailRecipient%%".

They get through because the envelope is set right, just not the email. You
can think of it like a letter: the mail server, when it receives a letter
for you, takes the letter out of the envelope and pops it into your Inbox
(then discards the envelope). If the letter's blank due to the sender's
incompetence, then so be it.

You can when part of the problem is the network-specific changes to  
the phone.  My ex-boss's Sony Ericsson was completely ransacked by  
Vodafone's customisations, with some features actually removed by  
them.  Orange have also been a little heavy-handed with firmware  
recently.

Right now, I have problems with the phone, AND the network, AND the  
network's changes to the phone.

Also, the location of the cells isn't necessarily the problem...  
sometimes oversubscription can be an issue, especially in central  
London.  More than once, I've been able to get a signal on Orange,  
when people with me have got "Network Busy" on Vodafone.

Anyway, my problem right now with Orange is value-for-money. They  
haven't improved the offering for existing customers, and they've  
started taking features away (eg. decent insurance).

With regards to the Samsung D500:  one of my colleagues had (I think)  
a D500.. We all loved the form factor, and the extremely satisfying  
"clunk" (almost worth getting just for that), but he finally got rid  
of it in favour of a second-hand Nokia.  He said the software was  
rubbish, and it wouldn't sync with his Mac.
