Almost certainly spam sent by people using "easy-to-use" spamming software
that they haven't bothered to read the instructions for. I get plenty
addressed to things like "To: %%emailRecipient%%".

They get through because the envelope is set right, just not the email. You
can think of it like a letter: the mail server, when it receives a letter
for you, takes the letter out of the envelope and pops it into your Inbox
(then discards the envelope). If the letter's blank due to the sender's
incompetence, then so be it.

View the raw source of the message,

You may find its just a flakey script,

Its likely that your antivirus ate it,

Your mailserver would have reject it,

Hi all,

I'd like to use the equivalent of an iframe under an XHTML 1.0 'Strict'
doctype, but I'm aware they're not supported.  So, use an object element
instead, right?  Nope, and you can probably guess why; IE doesn't appear to
support the use of object elements in this way.  Here's a code
sample--before:

<iframe src="<c:url value="/unity/browse-hierarchies.html"/>"
id="article-browser-tree-viewer">
    <h5>Error</h5>
    <p>You need a modern, Standards-compliant web browser to use this
system. Unfortunately, your current browser does not appear to meet these
requirements.</p>
    <p>Please log in again using an up-to-date version of one of the
following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Microsoft
Internet Explorer</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Mozilla
Firefox</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple Safari</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thank you, and apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
</iframe>

...and after:

<object type="text/html" data="<c:url value="/unity/browse-hierarchies.html"/>"
id="article-browser-tree-viewer">
    [as above]
</object>

Whilt I appreciate the 'type' attribute isn't strictly required below XHTML
1.1, I'm struggling to understand why IE won't render this.  More hard-coded
assumptions on Microsoft's part?  Any tips, tricks or alternative
suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Why do you need an iframe? To display content from another source or for
some sort of dynamic content?

Both.  Plus it needs to be in a scrollable area, and, again, IE doesn't
support scrollable areas created using pure CSS well at all.

IE's OBJECT support is badly broken (not that it's alone in that respect,
mind). 

I'd just use an XHTML Transitional DOCTYPE and be done with it. That's what
it's for, after all.

The problem is that that elements arranged inside this scrollable area have
quite a lot of CSS governing their layout.  When you attempt to use a div
element with restricted dimensions and scrollable content, IE draws the
scrollbars to the correct size, but then draws all the content over the
top--and outside the boundaries of the scrollable area, as though it were
just inline stuff at full width.

Very odd, but it works absolutely fine in other major browsers so I know the
underlying markup and CSS is sound.

I've just had a phone call from someone. "Oh, you'll be surprised to
get this call, I expect".

yes - I was. Because I had looked at his web site yesterday, and he
extracted our IP from his logs (presumably), and discovering that I
was a web developer, rang me up to see why I was looking at them, and
what I thought of them.

now, I know that web logs catch this information - and indeed, we
capture it ourselves, and analyse it. But I would never *ever* dream
of phoning someone who had appeared in my web logs - I think that's a
real invasion of privacy.

am I alone?

Mac,
Surely the invasion of privacy, if there was any, took place when your
IP was recorded?

The subsequent follow up was just normal sales practice. Better than a
cold call because you had shown some interest in their site and had
already trawled it for information on them. If we notice potential
customers using our site, I will often get in touch to see if we can
sell them a customised version.

Selling's not fun, but has to be done.

Yup, dozens per day.

I wondered if they were spam designed to screw with spam filters in  
some way,
perhaps by messing with the weighting given to the content of certain  
header
attributes. Or something. Incompetent spammers sounds more plausible

Definitely not.  I think that is *really* bad and intrusive, and also
somewhat creepy.  I would write an email of complaint to the company, if it
were me.

I've had sales calls from websites in the past, which pisses me off too, but
at least on those occassions I actually gave my number in order to register
or somesuch.  I just didn't realise it would result in a sales call.

Actually, come to think of it, I have also had emails from websites I have
been on and not registered with - one step down from the situation you're
in.  I hate that too and always complain.

web logs *do* record IPs.  I understand that, I'm happy with it.
That's not an invasion of privacy.

no sorry - I don't think phoning someone because they have simply
visited your site is acceptable.  If they have filled in a form saying
"contact me", yes, that's fine, obviously.  Visiting a site does *not*
mean that you are in the market for someone's products.

and anyway - this guy wasn't selling anything.

I used to work for a very well-known hobby company that had made its
intentions to go online (finally!) very widely know.  I seem to recall at
least two development contracting companies who rang the office after
picking their way through their weblogs; we'd been browsing around for
people do some bespoke work and had taken a look at their web site a couple
of days before.

I'd never do that either, but I think "invasion of privacy" may not be
the best term to describe it. Echelon - now *that* is an invasion of
privacy. "Waste of time" might be a better description. After all, they
didn't access any private data of yours - you knew your IP would be
logged and your domain details are openly available. Having said that,
I'd feel pissed off too - can't stand unsolicited calls, whatever the
guise.

Probably not, but I don't see what the big deal is _in this instance_. 
Google (as a ferinstance) will have much more extensive records of your

If you don't like it, browse through an anonymising service.

it's not my browsing habits - I don't give a toss about someone seeing
those (which is probably just as well :).

it's the fact that this person saw fit to phone me.  I see it as a
step way too far.

Nor does owning a house, but that doesn't stop the little gits knocking 
on my door on a regular basis. And nor does having a phone number, even 
an ex-directory 'don't sales call me' listed one, but again, that 
doesn't stop them cold calling me.

I don't see it as being worse than any of the above (and equally no less 
annoying)

I think you missed the point; Google don't then call you to try and sell you
products relevant to the search term(s) you were using.

I know that's not specifically what mac's experience was, but it's not
overly dissimilar--mostly it's reversed.

this guy's site wasn't even *selling anything* - he just phoned "to
see what I thought".

I can only assume he doesn't get many visitors!

Sure - that's what my (somewhat vague) "reversed" comment was about.  But,
surely seeing you were a web developer, he must have asked for suggestions
or recommendations of some sort?  Otherwise... what was his point, exactly?
Creep you out?  Sounds like a successful exercise if it was.

But I've done this recently, but to stop a company's spastic spider
issuing a DoS on a bunch of sites.

I honestly don't know what his point was.  And I'm too busy to give
people free critiques, and I was too taken aback. to be honest.

woohoo! i'm loving these lightbox variations - in the fictional world where
I actually have spare time i'd replace a whole load of stuff in  bespoke web
apps i've built over the years.

It's like the web is going through a whole second generation or something
;-)

Hi

My mum needs a laptop.

What would you recommend for surfing, word processing, book-keeping, 
photos etc.

It's got to have wireless .

Plus she lives on the isle of man so I need to keep an eye on ability to 
send it back if it goes wrong.

Cheers

Does that mean it needs to come pre-installed with birch_homosexuals.exe as

I think "rant" is a bit strong, TBH.  And it's hardly all day.

Depends, got a mate who bought his Grandad and iMac and was never off the
phone to him...

Juan, what do you use? As I guess you're going to end up doing the support
get her something you're familiar with, if that's a Mac follow Tom's advice
and by her a Mac, if it's a PC buy her a PC and be prepared to secure it and
make sure it get's updated regularly...

I recommend the low end Dell's.  Got my Dad one, and they are good for the
price (lowend spec about ?400?), and also have great support packages -
which is handy else I end up being his Support Package ;)

I was thinking MacBook - it would stop her thinking she's going to get a 
virus every time she pressed the mouse - I'll just have to find out if 
she can use her bookkeeping software on it.

But, on the other hand, she also wants to upgrade her Windows 98 desktop 
to something newer - and I think it will blow her mind if I tell her 
there's more than one operating system.

If one type of battery in one type of laptop explodes (and they have already
started a product recall), I hardly consider that cause for concern, if
that's what your point is.

Someone's been reading too many sensationalist papers methinks ;)

Mac for old people work big time - My grandad bought his IMac back in 2001
and to this day still uses it fine for everything. He's had a few issues
along the way but no spyware or major viral infestation.

Go with the mac.

My mum refuses to change any overhead light bulbs, as she thinks the  
electricity will drip on her.  That's how technical she is.  Anyway,  
she has an XP desktop my dad set up, and the iBook I gave her.  She  
doesn't know about operating systems... just whether she's using the  
PC or the iBook.

I sent her an iSight, and she managed to connect it, set up and  
talking to me in about five minutes just by reading the pamphlet.   
She's also mastered the iPod mini I got her, again just by reading  
the pamphlet.

In all, I've had to give her barely any help with the iBook at all,  
but the PC's another matter.

She still uses the PC out of habit (and since there isn't a *good*  
Scrabble clone for Mac, or Freecell for that matter), but she's gone  
on holiday to the States with the iBook, and I wouldn't be surprised  
if she switches when she gets back.

With regards to the bookkeeping software: yes, that could be a  
problem.  Sure, you could set up Parallels, BootCamp or whatever, but  
then you might as well get a PC.

Bon apres-midi,

I've not had much experience with PDF since Acrobat 4 and Flash since
Flash 2 or something archaic like that, so I was surprised to learn of
a co-worker's desire to have "animated PDFs" - ie Flash movies
embedded inside PDF documents.

Can you *do* that?

Well, no. You could disable networking and at least then it's a

MYOB is reputed to be "OK" for the Mac.

Subject: [_] FTP client followup
Message-ID: <C0F512AE.26B5E%oliver@watershed.co.uk>


Just a quick followup re FTP clients (and because I need to rant)...

Someone here said CuteFTP was OK. I've just had the displeasure of testing a
site with it.

It may work fine in "standard" environments, but it assumes too much about
the remote server and won't ignore unimportant errors if it can't get its
way.

So for instance, I've set up a drop box system with severely limited
permissions: every other FTP client I've tried, Mac PC and Unix, will upload
fine. CuteFTP throws an error because it can't "PWD" on login (and hence
won't upload, presumably because it doesn't know which directory it's in).
If you allow PWD it moans about not being able to CWD before uploading, and
*still* won't upload - grrr. Fine, I allowed CWD. But because accounts are
revoked as soon as an upload finishes, and CuteFTP won't believe the
server's "all OK" signal and has to refresh the listings to make sure, it
can't even tell the user the upload was successful. Arrrghhhhhh....

It's unreliable, badly coded rubbish. Steer well clear.

Oliver.

Yeah, if it were me.  I wouldn't personally set up a dual-boot or  
virtualised OS for a non-techie.  Double the support hassle.   
Definitely not something you want to set up or maintain over the phone.

Tom

PS. Incidentally, I'm assuming Juan's mum is a non-techie, which I  
guess could be construed as sexist/ageist/whatever.  My apologies if  
that's not the case, but I'd assume the same about dads, brothers,  
sisters, cousins, sons, daughters, etc., as there are far more non- 
techies than techies, and I wouldn't wish Windows on *anyone* anyway.

Haven't had the 'pleasure' of using that tripe for over 6 years! Heavy 
FTP use on Windows really comes down to FTP Voyager or FTP Rush. Both of 
which are solid, mature and flexible apps. Rush is probably my favourite 
of the two, with the best interface (and *stacks* of features, which is 
what I need) - probably overkill for a casual user / office peon.

Message-ID: <542f5d890608010646u3874bacdg7ab60ccb6f6987b@mail.gmail.com>

Just looked at the info sheet the Post Office put through my door
about the new pricing scheme. (Described as "as a megadisaster in the
making" according to the BBC website).

They clearly state that 25mm = 1 inch. So if your envelope is a little
too big, get them to measure it in inches.

Does this man really look the type to want to trick people into  
thinking there are more inches than there really are?

Definately not a clone of sage, it actually includes much much more
and is far more intuitive and easier to use, the only oddity i found
was to do with VAT and how Sage 'flags' things which you kind of have
to do manually in MYOB. I would definately recommend it. If you use
sage you will have no problems as it is a million times simpler to
use. Although I would recommend swapping at year end!

yes indeed. go for accounting plus version. we can also do payroll and 
stock control.

at end of year i just instructed our accountant to download a trial 
version and emailed him our company file. he did all the exports that 
he needed and all was well.

Yes, it does all kinds of stuff. We used to use it a few years ago,  
and it was great. There are several different versions -  see http:// 
www.myob.co.uk. Our accountant didn't like it, but that was mostly  
because he was a bit of a luddite and got confused by anything new.

Sully Partnership on Unity Street. Ian Bascombe. Not the cheapest, it
has to be said but they really got me out of the shit a couple of
years back and they mainly deal with sole traders and small companies
so they have been invaluable in doing things like reminding me to send
vital forms back etc etc!

Well, it works like this:  I would like to come down and join in on a chat
when you guys next do a Skillswap or similar piss up disguised industry
chat.  I want to chat particularly about the noo meedja scene, and also the
way you guys go about getting jobs.

When that happens, I will certainly buy a round or two.
:-)

Also, if it comes to pass that there are ways I could sponsor events to
raise the profile of Chinwag Jobs, more free beer will ensue.  I want the
service to become such that it is not just London new media peeps using it,
and becomes a more national service.

In fact, if any of you have any thoughts on Chinwag Jobs I would love to
hear them.  Feel free to be as brutal or complimentary as you like ;)

Well I did mail you off list about SkillSwap but anyway, the next one
is in September and presently it is the last one I think I have
funding for, not entirely sure would have to check. So offers of
sponsorship would be well received :)

Hi again underscorers...

Can anyone recommend a good mobile phone, the conversation usually
comes up here every now and again, so I figure someone will know
the sort of thing that would suit. I need the following features:

1) can make calls - reliably
2) can receive calls - reliably
3) can send text messages - reliably
4) can recv text messages - reliably
5) Compatibility with gnokii or some easy to install FreeBSD app.
 (reliably compatible!)

It would also be nice to have: reliable 3G and a good reliable
camera too.

BUT... I've had a Nokia N70 since a few weeks after they came out
and it's been no end of trouble. It's also with Orange, and they
don't seem to be quite as good as they used to be either.

I would rather have a non "smart" (which seems to mean stupid things
that break) phone, and I'm not even going to consider anything
running symbian or anything that has been touched by Microsoft!

Thanks folks, 

	Steve Roome

I have no idea what number 5 is but I just got a new phone from O2 its
a Samsung SGH-E780 which is exclusive to O2 and its great! small,
flippy phone, good camera, mp3 player thing, it rings, you can call
people and it does texts. Not tried any of the fancy stuff.

Yeah, I'm really sorry I haven't had chance to get back yet, that is pretty
bad of me.  I keep meaning too and then work gets in the way (damn work!).
Same with Matt actually (sorry Matt).

Would be very interested in sponsoring the coming events.  I tried to talk
to Andy the skillswap man but sadly he didn't want to chat on the phone and
I hate having email discussions about anything fairly involved.

Cool, will you be posting details of the venue etc nearer the time?  Or can
I sign up to a list someplace? :)

Hi Steve,

I just got a Sony Ericsson K800i on 3 and I am chuffed to pieces with it.
What's the FreeBSD compatibility for?

Having spent a few years in the mobile phones industry, I imagine I am a bit
of a PITA in the ass as a mobile customer. ;-)

Ta,

Ben

hmm, i think small, scalable animated vector graphics could be quite
good in a pdf, could convey a lot without using multiple pages

or maybe even video (which would of course be less small or scalable ;))

I did like the look of the K800i but I figure that it's a funky new
phone with lots of features on it. So by the time _I_ have used it
it will probably try to destroy itself in a week or two.

Then again, it was already top of my list.

I'd like to be able sync the address book and contacts with FreeBSD
and also be able to send/recv texts from unix also. Something with
AT compatibility would be nice, but I doubt that's very likely
these days. To be honest, it is essential to be able to back up the
address book as it's the only one I have, getting 3G connections
would be nice too for mobile internet access on the computer, but
I figure this is a bit of a pipe dream while I'm still with Orange.

(Trust me, it's not particularly usable and having spent nearly
two grand on it over the last year I could do with changing provider!)

Also would be nice to be able to use the memory card from my N70
(which is a heap o' junk!) in whatever I get, can't remember for
the life of me which of the seven thousand different types of
memory card is the one that I should be using though.

Aside from the sensible phone recommendation, bread product animal abuse
is not something I'd admit to on here, or is it a more relaxed atmosphere
these days?

Just got my folks a new macbook today their pc users for some years
and the macbook knocked their socks off.

They purchased the middle of the range version it's really fast and
quite handsome too boot, they only really use the internet and do a
bit of emailing so this will suit them down to the ground. I taught
them how to use the tracker pad to navigate and trash things and their
really happy how everything works. Front-row works really well with
the remote and the slide show in iphoto with the cheesy music was a
nice touch.

But for a parent friendly computer you can't go far wrong, it did
cross my mind to ask if they would swap for my powerbook but i'm sure
I'd have to prize it out of their hands with a crowbar.
But l'll inherted a two year old dell for my java programing and virus
scanning so it all worked out well for me too!

Well, until regular paper can do that, including it in PDF would just  
cause problems, imho.

I still can't get the supplied software to do this with Windows. It threw
all sorts of nasty looking errors during installation and won't let me
uninstall. However, it seems to be doing what it is meant to, which isn't a
lot - file transfer mainly.

Having said that, it is a very new phone. 3 haven't developed the handset
software to do push email yet, but I am assured it will be ready within the
next few months.

>I figure this is a bit of a pipe dream while I'm still with Orange.

There are ways and means to end contracts very early. ;-)

>Also would be nice to be able to use the memory card from my N70

The K800i uses an "M2" card, which is about as proprietary as they come. I
got 1GB for about 50 squids IIRC.

>is it a more relaxed atmosphere these days?

I have only had a couple of fairly mild comments about that screw up so far,
so I guess so!

Subject: [_] div height issue with firefox
Message-ID: <44CF9F0E.7020203@firecast.co.uk>

I know this is a really simple one but either my brain is fried or the
cider has finally done its work but, I'm having an issue with a site I'm
putting together where the dontect of a div is being imported from a
database.

As a result the div height varies with the amount of content entered. In
IE this div resizes and all subsequent divs move to give it space.
However in firefox and safari this isn't happening. instead div that is
having content fedd into it simply appears to overlap any divs placed
below it in the page.

An example would be two boxes on above the other, where if the height of
the top one changes the other should move down, howeer in FF it simply
overlaps it.

I think this is due to misplaced clear:both; styles, however any help
would be much appreciated

Thanks

That's not the problem...  Question is, what plan/network instead?

(This thread is the result of a chat Steve and I had earlier today)

We got our phones at about the same time back in 1996, when Orange  
was still an innovative company: cheap bundled minutes (while  
everyone else had all calls as billable), free itemised bills, "free"  
answerphone, Demon POP, free no-quibbles insurance with no premium,  
good customer service and technical support, line 2, etc.

Now everyone else has caught up, so Orange is just overpriced, with a  
small range of phones, bad customer service, expensive limited  
insurance, and no nice offers for existing customers.  Since Hans  
Snook left, it's just been getting worse.  I blame the silly 3G  
licence bidding too.

Both of us have been loyal Orange contract customers for almost 10  
years, so neither of us have any idea who to move to.  *shrug*

if there are floats involved then this could well be the case - can you

Message-ID: <C8FA2E5A-262D-4C8F-A99B-F0B7985D7631@matthewwilkes.name>

Hello all,

I'm using PostcodeAnywhere to resolve postcodes to lat/lon pairs and  
plot them on google maps, but I've found a strange bug.  When I look  
up house 11 in BS8 4PS (my old house), it returns:

51.4510020636617, -2.61817631453612

instead of something on the lines of

51.4515398586836, -2.61967062950134

The upshot of this means it's shifted south east, meaning the houses  
resolved are showing up on Clifton Vale, not Saint Vincent's Road.   
Strangely, if I put in number 7, it is translated up clifton vale, by  
the same amount as it should be on St. Vincent's.  Am I just doing  
something stupid when putting them into google maps.  On their  
generated maps it shows up in the right place, so am I doing  
something stupid when putting them into google maps?  Is there some  
sort of clifton transform that needs to be applied? ;)

Any thoughts at all would be greatly appreciated, as this has me  
stumped and I'm not expert on the whole latitude/longitude system.

Matt

I've just been setting up my everything onto MYOB, and it seems  
alright (The main problem is translating your business concepts to  
something Accountants like to look at), notice there's a 50% sale on  
right now at the site.  If you don't get it before it ends make sure  
you buy form EBuyer or similar, as it's a good ?80 cheaper than on MYOB.

Unfortunately, that article isn't the whole story.  It looks like  
Google Maps is calibrated against one of the americanocentric  
geodetic systems... probably WGS84, as used by GPS.

IIRC, in that frame of reference, the Greenwich Meridian *is* about  
100m west of 0? longitude.

It's not a mistake.  It's just yet another case of sheer bloody- 
mindedness by us yanks.

Oh thank god I decided to record the whole postcode anywhere  
response.  I've now grabbed the WGS84 information that got returned  
at the same time, and everything works to a lovely accuracy.

Depressingly, I had thought of using that before, but the page must  
have been cached when I checked it out.

Anyway, thanks very much, I'd been pondering that one all day!

I did this, it was a lot of work and I was never quite sure I was  
doing it right.  So then we got a book-keeper.  They cost ?12-20 /  
hour, which depending on your trading volume could work out as not  
that much per month.  Saves headache.  It's one thing most people  
regret trying to save money on...

It is worth doing a bit of book-keeping so you know how to work with  
a book-keeper.

Still use MYOB for tracking invoicing.  Just my 2p.

cheers,

andy

I went with 3 because:

- they offer unbeatable deals

- the multimedia content satisfies the geek side of me

- they "piggy back" on O2 so reception is always going to be comparable to
other networks

I got a free K800i with the following tariff:

First 6 months @ ?15:
- 600 Minutes
- 2000 SMS
- 50 MMS
- ?5 inclusive downloads
- some video calls but I am unlikely to use them

After the first 6 months, the tariff goes up to ?30, but can be changed at
that point to any tariff I like. I also went for an email bundle for ?5 per
month that gives me unlimited emails (50MB fair usage).

The deal breaker for me with 3 is the walled garden. I find it  
baffling that they won't allow access to the internet. I'd love to be

I have a k800i on Vodafone. It works with iSync on the Mac (it
just needs a quick hack to convince the Mac it's known about).
I got it working as a bluetooth modem through the Mac the other day  
using
Ross Barker's dial scripts (from which you should be able to glean
the AT commands).

I'm really, really happy with it. It's the dinkiest 3.2M pixel bluetooth
camera I've ever owned.

Bad news: the Sony has it's own dinky little M2 card. I dropped the
?50 on a 1G (512M?).

They do, but it costs extra. You can buy an monthly cost addon
(?2.50/5MB, ?5/15MB) or a no-monthly cost addon (?2/MB).

I *think* that any network charges you for data download in one way or
another and I *think* that I get a certain amount of data download included
in my tariff.

Andy runs the Brighton one and I do the Bristol one. You can sign up
at www.skillswap.org for the Bristol group and you will get a
notification when the event is publicised. And I normally post it to
[_] too.

Also if you want to do payroll or any kind of stock control go for
MYOB Accounting Plus, if you dont need those I think the basic one is
sufficient. Actually have to say the Payroll function was one of the
best bits of it for us as so much easier to manage than Sage Payroll ,
with no limit on employees and you dont have to pay for the annual
updates you just update the tax and NI rates yourself.

I looked at the very basic one and thought WTF? Where's the purchase ledger?!

I'm now looking at Accounting and it looks very good - just need to
find time (ho bloody ho) to run it in parallel for a month.  But it's
looking good.

I just got a great deal with O2, i was going to cancel my contract and
go on pay as you go or whatever so I called up to cancel my ?30 per
month O2 online contract which included 200 x-network mins and 500
texts and they instantly offered me the same package for ?15 a month,
a new phone and free phone insurance! I didnt even haggle! The only
thing I stipulated was that I wouldnt go for an 18 month contract only
12 and they said that was fine. I also discovered i had been with them
for 2051 days at that point!! Apparently they didnt want to lose me!
So I suggest that you tell your current supplier you are going to
cancel and see what you get.

I really like my new phone except for it doesnt work with iSync which
is a total pain in the ass as I had a real problem getting my numbers
onto it (faffing around with the SIM card) and now cant back up and
new ones :( So if anyone is aware of a hack for the Samsung phones
please let me know :)

You think that's bad? 20MB on Orange costs ?16. It's obscene. I've  
got the 4MB bundle: ?4/m, which of course is even worse. Also, what  
the fuck's with charging for insurance *and* charging a hefty excess  
on any claim?

Not only am I hating Orange right now, but I'm hating my bloody Treo  
too. It's unstable, the interface is terrible and unintuitive, the  
shiny stuff that I thought was metal when I bought it is cheap  
plastic, and all the shiny stuff is rubbing off making it look  
terrible, and it's started to crack now. That's quite apart from the  
fact that it's big and ugly anyway, and managed to wipe all the  
contacts on my Mac when I synced it after a reset (yeah, great: treat  
the empty phone as the definitive list). Orange told me I needed to  
reset the damn thing when it first screwed up!

I have a year left on an 18 month contract. I could upgrade to  
another phone by paying ?50 upgrade fee, but that would mean I'd need  
to sign another contract with these wankers. I could probably buy  
myself out of my contract. That would probably be extortionately  
expensive, and I'd need to battle them to tell me how much. Grrr.

12 months x lowest tariff (?19 / month) = ?228

Then take off the money you would get from eBaying the Treo

?228 - maybe ?150 (http://tinyurl.com/s6hsu) = prolly worth doing.

If the case is buggered, you may want to spend the ?15 it costs to get a new
one and the right tools to fit it.

Exactly. PDF should be about replacing paper, or making 'paper'  
available over networks. All this interactive stuff is spoiling that.  
Animated stuff ruins the WYSIWYG (damn, haven't said that this  
millennium) concept that's PDF's great strength. The only dynamic  
thing that I think is good are forms. I love it when downloadable  
forms let me fill out the details before printing, mainly because my  
handwriting is terrible, but also because they can do clever stuff  
like disabling irrelevant bits of the form, and copying values  
around. Great for tax forms.

Pay-as-you-go SIM (?20 every ~2 months) and an antique Nokia (>4 years old).

It's a test version of the site so not exactly polished but you can see
the issue that I was talking about with the list of items on this page.

Put the following always as the *last* element inside div.product_list:

<div style="clear: both"><!-- force expansion --></div>

Should see you right.  And yes, it's floats not clearing subsequent content
that's the problem.

I know exactly what you mean. Im currently suffering with a T-Mobile  
MDA and the touchscreen doesnt work - you should try making a call  
with that :)

Im looking forward to when Nokia release this phone later this year -  
its on my shopping list already:

I hate to be a validation fascist, but you'll have a better chance of
a working layout when the HTML is fixed:
http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fge-mobilephones.com%2Ffge_test%2Ffge_2006%2Fshow_products.php%3Fcategory_id%3D47%26menu%3DMobile_Phones

Your CSS has some unit-less lengths (e.g. "margin-left: 5") as well:
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?profile=css2&warning=2&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fge-mobilephones.com%2Ffge_test%2Ffge_2006%2Fcss%2Ffge.css

Incidentally, I thought that using underscores in class or ID names
was bad form. Seems to validate OK, though.

Lots of your classes represent things that will only happen once on a
page (e.g. your *_wrapper classes) so they're better off as IDs.

Hi,

As all your items basically look the same and do the same things I would
give them all the same class which would include a left float and a width
and they will naturally line up (er hem!), then i would give my wrapping
div, "product_list", an overflow:auto rule to force firefox to wrap the
floated elements and push the div below down.

Incidentally, using underscores in your css names might cause some problems,
it was not initially in the W3C spec IIRC.

Hope that helps

I would tend to use <br style="clear:both" /> myself - lighter html  
and sounds more apt.

I'm even thinking of going back to my old T610 and buying a Nokia 770

Thanks for all your help. I know the mark-up is soup at the moment but I
can tighten that up once I have the initial format set.

I have used this method before but run into validation problems when two
divs have the same id and therefore css class applied. However I would
be interested in knowing what the advantage to applying css in this way
over the normal class artribute?

Style point, mostly. The only real differences are if you use the ID for
scripting (document.getElementById) or if you need greater specificity to
override a previous rule.

Personally, I like to use classes for most stuff. Even if I only think
there'll be just one example of a given widget on any page, amends down the
line may change that and if you've used an ID you're in for some pain. With
a class, it's no problem.

Also the specificity thang: if you use an ID to start, you're already nearly
at the highest specificity. There's #id.class, of course, but after that
it's off to contextual selectors or source order for greater specificity --
neither of which may be practical for whatever reason. If you start with a
class, you get one more level to play with.

But that's just me. There's no cut-and-dried way of doing it -- other than
only 1 of a given ID per page, of course.

Just be sure you do now ;) We'll be watching :p Incidentally, if you
get the page framework right from the start, you'll have fewer
problems later on once you start pouring in that messy content. It's
easier to patch a hole in an empty bucket.

You're only allowed one element with a given ID per document, so parts
of your page that are unique (header, sidebars, footer etc) should be
given IDs. Classes can be applied to as many elements per document as
you like, so are better off with things that there are more than one
of, like menus, call-out boxes etc.

Bear in mind, though, that most of your styling can be applied to
"bare" elements: h1-h6, ul, li, p, div etc. etc. Applying classes to
absolutely everything is tempting, but you miss out on the best
features of CSS: the cascade and inheritance.

E.g. you want paragraphs that appear within the sidebar to have
smaller text than regular paragraphs:

p { font-size: medium; }
#sidebar p { font-size: small; }

E.g. (2) you want headings within the products section of the site to be green:

h1 { color: blue }
body#products h1 { color: green; }
(assuming you add a body ID unique to each section)

It's powerful stuff :)

I would also point out the javascript: URLs and link directly to
www.domscripting.com - you want to gen up on "unobtrusive scripting"
:)

There is no reason (aside from DOM) why you cant use all classes or  
all IDs.
To be valid XHTML, you must only have one element per ID.

Generally speaking, if there is one occurance of an element in a  
page, use IDs.
If there is more than one, use a class.

The only benefit (ignoring DOM) of using id for single occurance  
elements is that "id" is 3 chars less than "class".

Just trying to make call with t-mobile unless your standing comletely
still seems to be a problem.  On my 3rd MDA...  Half way through an 18
month contract - is paying them off on the cheapest tariff the only way to
break out?

BTW where did all these 18 month contracts come from?  Did the law change
recently?  I thought they were previously only 12 months because that was
the longest they could contract you in for?

Yep. Although Carphone Whorehouse do an insurance policy (called Lifeline)
that will buy you out after 6 months, which is a very nice feature.

Surely there must be some way out of a contract like that.
Pay them out, then take them to small claims court for the full  
amount? Would set an awesome precedent.
Im sure there isn't a judge in the land that wouldnt consider it an  
unfair contract / breach if you are unable to get reception.

You actually probably only need Accounting.  Accounting still does  
stock & payroll.  Although Accounting Plus has 'better' payroll (not  
sure how, just remember the bumph) it's main advantage is allowing  
multiple users at any time.

I agree.  The book-keeper definitely makes life easier, although you  
need to learn the processes not only to talk to your book keeper but  
also grasp a better understanding of what's coming in/going out etc.

accounts don't frighten me - I was a partner in a company years ago
that wrote bespoke accounting systems, and I've always run full
accounts here so I know where we are.

thanks to all on the input re MYOB - I'm well impressed with it.

Sounds like MYOB would be good for us, but it lacks a Sales Order
Processing module (or at least I couldn't see one in the list of
features.) A system which can issue quotes, then turn some into sales
orders, which in turn can be progressed into invoices as the work is
completed (by month, or by quantity delivered) would be very useful.
MYOB helps you to see which invoices need to be collected, but does it
help you to see which orders need to be invoiced? I know that bigger
multi-user systems can do this, but has anyone found a cheap single-user
system that links sales quotes and orders into the invoice/accounts
system?

Rupert, I have MYOB Accounting Plus and it does exactly what you say,
you can create inquiries which you turn into quotes, into sales and
then invoice and you can track with their reporting how many inquiries
became sales etc.

And it is multi-user.

Does anyone know if it's possible to pull out keyframe data from an FLV file?
There are tools like flvmdi and flvtool2 which inject that data into
the metadata but I don't really want it injected just the info.

I can't seem to delve deep enough into the format to deconstruct with
a Hex editor. It might not be possible, just thought I'd ask!

Thanks,

Hi all

First of all - I haven't done this - (it's someone else who might have 
possibly done it).


a friend of a friend etc - might have accidentally used the wrong 
mailing list on a email mailout. This list belongs to person and they 
are not happy and are getting hassle from the people on the list for 
giving out there email addresses.

There's the threat of legal action for the person who allegedly sent out 
the mailout - even though it only happenned once and was a mistake - how 
would they stand legally?

I repeat - it's not me (just in case the FBI are on underscore).

My take on this is that you can do damage limitation by informing the users of the said list that it was a one off and that the person responsible has been hung and quartered. After all the mailing list was not sold to a third party, or made public.
The owner of the said mailing list may have abused the mailing list unintentionally, but not to the extent that the Data Protection Act has been contravened (providing the basics are in place such as receiver opted in, and that the receiver can easily opt out)

When I was doing some stuff with Orange development, they sent out a bulk list with all emails viewable in the CC field. This could have easily gone to court as they released email addresses without authorisation. (With current dealings with my Orange mobile, I sometimes wish I had chased it)

Could also be worth checking the mailings lists T's and C's for any opt out clauses, and if the users have to check the box to say that they have read them.

But this is only my non lawyer view...

I'm reading through all these ideas about phones very carefully,
but your comments Matt, sum up exactly how I'm feeling about
Orange and the heap of junk N70 they gave me. No end of problems
with it, including it confusing first and last names every time
it syncs with anything - it's old firmware, or my fault, it's
not easy though and comes with Orange Homescreen and Orange
"prices".

I'm getting more tempted by 3, but will have to pop down to
Bristol and find out what sort of reception I'd get round the
bottom of clifton / hotwells area as I'm moving back there
(fingers crossed) in about 3 weeks.

I think the point has been made perfectly clearly now:
   Orange suck.

I considered this also, but then I figure you'd actually have to
prove in the court that the reception was below the standards
that would be expected for the amount you pay. I thought that
the magistrates at a small claims court would probably not want
to set that sort of precedent on their own - maybe the high
court when it reaches appeal might work, but it's a long slog
for someone who has the balls to go through with it. I hope
someone does though!

Hi,

   don't blame the phone for the network and visa versa.
3 has many problems not least the fact that it uses O2 for its 2g network.
(Its working hard to sort that out but as I understand it, its
still an issue). I went back to orange after a year of hell from 3. They
even gave me money to go! (I could not complain too hard, as I worked for
the guys that sold them the software....)

If you want a good phone that is basic then a Samsung D500 is the best you
will ever get.
I'm not sure about your wish to sync with BSD but the rest is the best.

Its the ONLY phone my GF has ever had that she likes and has not broken. I
had one too and I bought a
third one when it was offered to me full price...

as for orange being bad then maybe you need to use sitesearch to figure out
who has what cells
where you want them :)

Best regards,

Peter

You can when part of the problem is the network-specific changes to  
the phone.  My ex-boss's Sony Ericsson was completely ransacked by  
Vodafone's customisations, with some features actually removed by  
them.  Orange have also been a little heavy-handed with firmware  
recently.

Right now, I have problems with the phone, AND the network, AND the  
network's changes to the phone.

Also, the location of the cells isn't necessarily the problem...  
sometimes oversubscription can be an issue, especially in central  
London.  More than once, I've been able to get a signal on Orange,  
when people with me have got "Network Busy" on Vodafone.

Anyway, my problem right now with Orange is value-for-money. They  
haven't improved the offering for existing customers, and they've  
started taking features away (eg. decent insurance).

With regards to the Samsung D500:  one of my colleagues had (I think)  
a D500.. We all loved the form factor, and the extremely satisfying  
"clunk" (almost worth getting just for that), but he finally got rid  
of it in favour of a second-hand Nokia.  He said the software was  
rubbish, and it wouldn't sync with his Mac.

TG:  My ex-boss's Sony Ericsson was completely ransacked by Vodafone's
customisations, with some features actually removed by them.  Orange have
also been a little heavy-handed with firmware recently.

+1, this sort of thing really gets my goat!!

A visit to the thug in his shop at the top of Park Street soon sorts this
out as an unlock reverts the phone to it's virgin state. Shouldn't be
necessary though!!

My 2p would be the only decent network in the UK is Vodafone. I've had crap
personal experience with both O2 and Three, and know many people who loath
Orange and T-Mobile. I've always found Vodafone service (both network and
customer) beyond reproach.

I like the design a lot. Nice stuff. Don't have time to peek about under the
hood though :(

Couple of minor things... in Safari (1.32), the front page grey-gradient
buttons ("Already know what you need", etc) have an added border under them
- i.e. the white dividers don't quite come to the bottom, and the bottom few
pixels don't roll over.

Second, the top buttons ("Products", etc) - their corners don't *quite*
match the background.

I also did a search for "test" - you may want to remove that page :)

Other than that - fun :)

Oliver.

Hey [_],

A year or so ago, someone asked if anyone had a copy of the utilities  
that come with Canon Digital SLR cameras (ImageBrowser,  
RemoteCapture, etc.)   I think I zipped up mine and sent them out.   
Now I'm the one asking :)

Canon's site only has updaters, rather than the initial versions.   
Unfortunately, my original CD is long lost.  If you've got the Mac  
utils for the EOS 300D (Digital Rebel), or the 350D (I think the  
utils are the same), please can I have a copy?

Cheers,

Tom

Canon?

 From this week's EPUK:

* "Del Monte ! Yer tea's on the table !"

Researchers find increasing trend for children to be named after
consumer goods, including 48 Canon's - every one of them fragile,
expensive to maintain, with teachers remarking on their "inability to
focus". (Incidentally, if baby Timberland grows up and murders his
parents, no jury will convict him)

Hi All

I am doing a multi lingual search sites, the first of many. Starting
off with English,German and Russian.

I have got a system that will change the text as needed but I want to
check to make sure it works with a variety of browsers.

Can you have a quick look just to make sure that it looks OK, don't
worry about the translation as this lot come from Babel Fish  and will
be done properly.

The URL is

http://www.elcome.ltd.uk/CDE_test/LangTest.asp

I have had a look at http://www.dejavu.org/emulator.htm and the only
ones that look OK are 'Internet explorer 2' and HOTJAVA.

I am after info about older browsers in particular.

Thanks for the help.

Try using @gmail.com anyway, it may work.

Looks good in Firefox 1.5.0.5...

Can you not sniff the browser's language settings instead of having to
get an explicit language choice from the user?

I will be doing that in the first place but then allowing the user to
change the language as they want. This page is just for testing to
make sure that it works.

yep I looked into it - if you sign up for a gmail account in the UK they
send as @googlemail, but anything sent to @gmail will still reach you.

Taking the bait - and giving the site the briefest of source code skimmings
- the only consistent fault with many pages is an empty <label> element.
Other than that, all I've noticed is one or two empty <p> elements in the
body.  Otherwise; good work.

+1 for the design from me too.  The only "improvement" I would suggest is
that you bin the antiquated JS image rollovers and use CSS instead; snappier
and much easier to manage in the future (plus it works without JS enabled...
obviously).

Not easily... I tried this a few weeks back, and the sign-up page is  
secured, so no proxy will help you there :(

As you've mentioned later, a @googlemail account will work just as  
well, and I'll assume they won't change this unless they lose the  
case nastily.

You can reconfigure the outgoing email address to send out as  
@gmail.  Even so, the headers will still have @googlemail in them,  
most obviously in "Sender:".

Another other option is to use GMail For Your Domain.  It looks like  
invites to the beta test are easy to get now, so you could just  
register a cheap domain and get GMail to manage it.

Incidentally, f.i.r.s.t.l.a.s.t, fir.stl.ast, fi.rs.tl.as.t, and all  
other combinations will work too.  They ignore dots, and (I think)  
other punctuation.  If you ask me, this should be a default setting  
in MTAs now.  Damn good idea.

I know if you ask the guys at the Folly Lane recycling centre, they'll know
which bin to put it in (usually the standard metal bin, and it all gets
sorted later apparently).

I actually *like* JS rollovers, as the CSS variety require faffing about
with image replacement, which is a PITA. Especially on a content-managed
site.

I've got a little JS widget that just walks through the links on the page
and looks for links containing a single image whose filename ends in
_off.[ext] where [ext] is the file extension (gif, jpg, png...heck even jpeg
will work fine), then attaches a mouseover behaviour swapping the src for an
image of the same name but ending in _on.[ext] which resides in the same
directory as the _off.[ext] image.

The script is also smart enough to do nothing and not complain if it doesn't
find any such links, and will also find INPUTs of type 'image' and do the
same with them.

Include that on every page, create your two image states, name them per the
convention and slap 'em in the page normally. MUCH easier than faffing about
with Gilder Levin Ryznar Jacoubsen IR (or whatever method the cool kids are
using these days).

You can do the background-position: hack instead, where you have both  
states stacked up on a single image, and it just crops the correct  
bit.  No image replacement necessary, and if your images come out of  
a graphics generator, there are less files to mess with.

Hi Andy.

A very pretty site. Hard to find anything functionally wrong with it.

My (very nit-picky) thoughts are:

- Fix markup so it validates correctly - there is an empty <label> on  
all the pages i saw.
- Shift body content nearer to the top of the markup, it currently  
appears around 3/4 the way down the page. This will help with  
accessibility / browser degradation.
- Remove unnecessary classes - do you really need to define classes  
for all of the identical elements within a named class?
- Remove JS rollovers - use a:hover CSS styles.
- Don't get into the habit of having browser-specific CSS styles (and  
therefore rules) - there is no reason to do this - it just means you  
are implementing the style in the incorrect way.
- Go xhtml-strict :)

But in all - thats just me being fussy. Lovely site all round.

Matt

That *is* image replacement ;) albeit using Pixy's single-image rollovers.

Image replacement (in this context) means replacing "foreground"
content with a background image (using CSS), *not* replacing one image
with another (using JavaScript).

Hi,

I have a client interested in Flash Lite gaming applications. What  
they really want to do is buy or license content 'off the shelf'  
rather than commission its development, so if anyone has any content  
available or web content that they think could be repurposed and  
would make for a good Flash Lite app then please get in touch.

I also have a constant need for J2ME coders and pixel artists should  
there be any lurking around these parts.

Please contact me off list and feel free to forward this mail to  
anyone you think may be interested. I'll be on holiday for a couple  
of weeks so don't worry if you don't get a response right away.

Actually, Tom was talking about having a single image with both  
"images" aligned next to each other.
On the "rollover" it simply shifts the position of the image to  
display the next image in alignment.
I.e. - not replacement - just moving.

Ya, the old video game sprite technique -- pimped that from Danny Goodman
for JS rollovers many years ago.

You could do automagic JS ones that way too, I suppose. Just encode the
sprite dimensions in the filename.

> No image replacement necessary,

So screw the folks who can't read the image text, people browsing without
CSS and/or images, etc.?

That's the nice thing about embedded images: the ALT attribute gives you
built-in accessibility. Not as good as real text as they still don't resize,
but not awful.

Pfft. P'shop, ImageReady or Fireworks (among others) will spit out however
many states you want with a single save, all named and ready to go. Managing
10 files instead of 20 doesn't seem like that great an advantage IMHO.

I know, and whether you do a static "replace text with one image" or
"replace text with one image which has two states in it, the other one
of which displays on mouseover", that's still an image replacement
technique.

Pixy was credited with having come up with the idea, and it extends
FIR/LIR and the rest to include rollovers.

What about managing 1 file instead of 20 if you simply use the CSS  
rollover image as a background for the foreground text?

Done that (once), works fine.  But, with respect to CK, this technique does
require no small amount of fiddling in CSS, and so maybe isn't the optimum
solution if you don't have hours to spare in your day.

Nuts. Danny Goodman had it on his site (in JS flavour) in 1998 or so.

Pixy just publicised it (and probably developed his technique independantly
drawing on the same video game inspiration).

I think this is one of those "been there, got the t-shirt" scenarios.
With experience, its very easy to get it right, very quickly.

Additionally, most of the work I do is CMS based, where site owners  
will need to be able to recreate navigation links that may have  
"rollover" states. This is, imho, the easiest, fastest, and most  
maintainable way of doing so.

Additionally, if the client requires a new design to be implemented  
throughout the site, the image rollovers can be replaced by simply  
changing an image (and if necessary a little CSS tweak), as opposed  
to recreating images for each link in the new style (and their  
rollovers)

So one file with 20 links worth of images? Uh, not for me. Thanks.

What happens when you need to amend the text in one? And if it changes
dimensions then? And besides which, you still have to do image-map style
math sorting where to place it for which state of which link -- far too much
brain work for my taste.

Set up slices, name 'em, save 'em, bung 'em into a folder and place
as-needed (or upload & place via CMS, if you're so inclined). Brain-dead
simple.

Mind, if you find it advantageous to work that way there really isn't
anything wrong with it. I just don't find it to be any advantage whatever.

Your clients not only have the fonts and software on their machine, but the
graphics skills to edit and optimise a 20-rollover image file?

They are most definitely cut from a different cloth than our clients.

Ah, so they're backgounds on an empty element and to hell with
accessibility, then?

Using background images to replace foreground for CSS-aware visual browsers
is what I meant by 'image replacement'. And I don't know any way around
doing that if you wanna make the links accessible.

Quick point..

Rollovers at the top of the page, the corner backgrounds aren't the  
same colour as the actual background.  The classic issue with gradients.

Also there's the delay as the rollover image loads..  You might want  
to change them to "sprite" type rollovers that don't have a load issue.

The grey divs don't resize vertically when the text gets bigger.   
Given the design they could without to much issue.

Cute little illustrations tho.

Hi Andy

Very nice site, easy to use navigation, good layout and style guide, and the
illustrations are brilliant - cute but informative,
good work allround, a good example of web devs and designers working well
together.

Chris.

I should read threads before replying :-)

I actually use one image for the whole menu with off, over, selected  
and selected over all in rows down the image then use the background- 
pos thing..

We tend to call it "sprite" rollovers over this neck of the woods.

Bah... I don't keep up with terminology :)  I wouldn't call that  
image replacement, and even if everyone else calls it that, then  
they're silly :)

It's the old (proper) meaning of the word "hack", meaning "neat  
trick".  I'd be surprised if the guys responsible of background- 
position: in CSS intended for it to be used for rollovers :)

I think this technique's been used at one point in just about every  
GUI since the seventies.  First time I used it on the web was in  
1995, using a Java applet to do the cropping, but I was using it  
probably ten years before on the BBC Micro.  I think one of the early  
Java example applets used this technique, which is where I probably  
nicked the code from.

Sure, but even if you have the JS there to set up the rollovers, I  
think it would be better to get the JS to generate CSS rather than  
try to wrangle the mouse events.  Less likely to screw up.

*shrug* The JS approach won't tackle that either.  The last site I  
worked on used buttons that looked like this:

    +---------------+
    | [] Contact Us |
    +---------------+

where [] was the icon, using background-position:, and "Contact Us"  
was plain anchor text, thus accessible.  The CSS generation, the PNG  
generation, and the HTML output were managed by a single PHP object  
in the CMS, allowing:

	$sidebar[] = new SidebarButton('home',      'Main Menu');
	$sidebar[] = new SidebarButton('products',  'Products');
	$sidebar[] = new SidebarButton('services',  'Services');
	$sidebar[] = new SidebarButton('contactus', 'Contact Us');
	...
	<?php echo $sidebar->html() ?>

...or even better, pulling the list out of a table.

with '/data/gfx/src/themes/standard/contactus.png', etc. having the  
icon source (at 3x normal size), used to generate the strip of  
rollover images for the given theme's parameters, generated by  
compositing the icon source on top of procedural gradients,  
background colours, button surrounds, etc., and then sampling down.

This way, the icons just existed in an abstract state on the NAS for  
the designer to play with, and all changes to the theme (eg. colour  
and size tweaks) regenerated all the rollovers automatically on use.

SidebarButton was inherited (through several levels) from  
ImageProducer (itself a subclass of ImageFactory) which handled  
filing and caching, and implemented the HTMLSerializable interface.

This stuff's the kind of thing you write once and then reuse  
everywhere.  I'm planning to wire it into my new Wordpress theme.

Incidentally, strips tend to be smaller when written out vertically  
rather than horizontally, so a horizontal-first compressor has an  
easier job.

Photoshop, ImageReady and Fireworks aren't proper graphics  
generators.  IMHO, most graphics should come out of scripts to make  
maintainability easier.  At the very least, there should be something  
like an Automator.app or Folder Action pipeline to ensure consistency.

How many times do you see sites that have a menu button at the end of  
a row that looks slightly different because it was added later?

I point and laugh at CMSes that don't have image management and  
graphics generation facilities.  There's no excuse anymore, with GD  
and ImageMagick so easily accessible from PHP and Perl.  Hell, I was  
doing this back when it had to be done in C!

????

No earthly idea what you mean by 'screw up'. JS rollovers are about as
well-sorted as any technique on the web.

When you get into making stuff appear and disappear with mouse events things
can get tetchy, but just swapping an image when the cursor moves over or off
it is as simple as it gets.

There's this nifty thing called the 'ALT' attribute. You put text in there,
and screen readers and browser which either can't show images or have them
turned off use that instead of the images. :-)

<snip />

That's not a text image. Different application entirely. 

The site in question is using image text, which means a different image for
each link -- and they're all different sizes too, which means the CSS gets
fiddly in a hurry.

Ya, great. Now what happens when the text doesn't fit the area you assumed
it would? Or can your generator optically adjust tracking and line breaks?
;-)

TBH, if you've got *that* many text GIFs, I'd vote to change the design.
Nicely-styled text is bettter.

Consistency isn't necessarily desirable. Different images may benefit
immensely from different colour palettes (difficult with a single
humongoloid image file), different levels of compression, etc. It really
depends on the specific application.

And honestly, if someone can't generate consistent results out of a graphics
editor they should really consider a less demanding career. Like stableboy
or some such. :-)

Not that terribly often, really. Most of the larger sites I frequent use
HTML text for navigation.

And that's just sloppiness anyway. Any non-trivial site ought to have a
style guide of some sort and the original production files should be
available for amends and the like. It's not exactly rocket science here.

Can they render text respectably now? I haven't a clue. It's been ages since
I saw their output and knew that's what it was, but at the time it was the
worst anti-aliasing this side of the GIMP, which was/is pretty grim itself
(as .

Regardless, we don't have those options here. We're all-MS, all the time.
And while .Net can do acceptable image generation itself (maybe better than
acceptable; I've only seen demos by programmers who had no clue what they
were playing at WRT typography), thus far the senior developer's managed to
do the 'well...we /could/ do that, but...' dance and avoid it.

He's really a very talented dancer. :-)

I agree that if you've got LOTS of images to create, then server-side
scripting's the way to go -- for sanity's sake if nothing else. And TBH, the
auto-wiring JS rollover thing sounds like it'd be a brilliant match for
that, too. 

But like I said at the outset, if you've got that many text GIFs I'd
strongly recommend rethinking the typography: image text isn't resizeable,
and there are far, far more people who have poor vision than have none at
all. AFAIC, resizeability is one of the more important bits of
accessibility.

Sorry Chris,

I think you misunderstood my point with your last couple of emails.
The text itself would be in the markup. The background is all that  
would be contained within the rollovers. i.e. just two-states for the  
basic rollover.

Seems ok now, may have been my browser if you haven't changed anything.

One other small  thing is on the client page if you have them all open
and the page scrolls, the a href="#" takes you to the top of the page
moving hat you clicked on, which is confusing. 

Not sure if this is the acceptable [_] authorized solution :) 

But instead of

<a href="../case_studies_and_client_list#" onclick="shoh('1');">

try 

<a href="../case_studies_and_client_list" onclick="return shoh('1')">

Instead and add 

return false;

to the last line of you JS function shoh()

No - the elements contain the text of the link. The background is

That would be done in a different way - using a nested hidden element  
- and it wouldn't degrade well.

Hi [_] gurus,

WRT accessibility and 'skip to nav' links etc, which way is better to hide
them from the 'normal' user? (ok, I know it's probably best to have them
visible anyway, but in this case the design/designer doesn't allow for it)

display: none;

visibility: hidden;

or is it better to position them way outta the viewport? Or indeed any other
techniques?

Any advice would be welcomed.

Thanks,

theUKdude

IMHO this approach doesn't do enough to seperate the markup from the
presentation - the holy grail for menu generation me is something like ths:-

CMS generates a UL for the menu with a few descriptive classes applied.

Graphic designer draws pretty picture to demonstrate how the menu should
look

Sitebulder/ CSS person makes the menu happen.

The approach you described probably has the same resuklt, but it's all tied
up in programming whereas I prefer the CMS to generate only markup, and
maybe /manage/ the CSS and images, but not generate them

Outta tha viewport is the only one screen readers will pick up.

@media 'aural' {
	display: block;
}

is supported by the last 1-2 versions of JAWS, IIRC, but not in other
readers to my knowledge.

Also, it's worth noting that JAWS (and most other readers, I believe, though
they're not enabled by default) has tools for skipping over long lists, so
if the nav is formatted as a list screen reader users will (mostly) have a
built-in 'skip nav' tool anyway.

"visibility: hidden" keeps the elements display properties (i.e.keeps  
its space on the page) so it would nudge the rest of your site out of  
position accordingly.

"display: none" is the preferred technique of the two, if used in  
conjunction with a "speak: normal". Unfortunately, many screen  
readers still do not support the aural media types, and this may  
still be hidden from screen readers.

Off-screen absolute positioning is the only way to reliably support  
all screenreaders (i.e. left: -100px). You will just want to keep the  
regular display style (i.e. not hidden!)

Enjoy!

Ah. Well. As I noted to Tom, that's a different scenario than on the site in
question, where the text is embedded in the image.

Ya, sure, if you can keep the image-y bits and colours, etc. separate from
the text, that's the route. And CSS-based effects are the dog's bits then,
as you often can reuse the same image(s) repeatedly.

I have been using "Mail Appetizer" for a while with Apple Mail.

For those unfamiliar, it will display a little splash on screen when  
you receive an email with basic information about the received mail  
to save me checking my mail all the time (i have 1000's of unread  
mail (junk) so I cant use that as the indicator i've received

Unfortunately, it seems to get very temperamental once in a while and  
just hangs, and I have to manually kill it to stop it blocking my

Anyone know a (free) alternative?

Thanks,

Anything to do with Javascript has the potential to screw up...  
usually because something before it has failed due to some unforeseen  
browser brainfart.  Sometimes Javascript can run slow, due to a bad  
Flash movie in the page (look at the current Nectar site through  
Camino or possibly Firefox... totally hoses my browser)

CSS, on the other hand, being declarative rather than imperative in  
nature suffers less from side-effects.


> That's not a text image. Different application entirely.

Same techniques and approaches apply.  There's no reason why the same  
code can't output text as images (with ALT) or as plain text  
depending on the theme.

Even sites with a single theme benefit from a theming mechanism, if  
only to test out new styles during beta test periods.

Not if you get the program to handle it for you.

Yep.  Not the one I'm currently using, but previous ones I've written  
have.  I put in metacharacters to adjust the spacing.  The  
ImageProducer class I talked about allows the creation of text to fit  
the image size, or image size to fit the text.  In a subclass I  
created for page titles, it would scale the text down and (slightly)  
tighten the tracking to a limit of -20%, and then start changing the  
image size.

The point is, this behaviour is programmable by a ruleset as complex  
as you need it to be.

In one site I did, I had 1000 pages to produce in a month, each with,  
on average, 3 or 4 headings that *had* to be done in Gill Sans.   
There were about 2000 sidebar buttons to do as well.  My generator  
put them together in about two minutes.

The graphic designer gave me a Photoshop mockup to work from and I  
produced "recipes" from there.  Took me about an hour to put them  
together.

We were able to tweak the site style right up minutes before Launch.

I don't believe in changing the design to fit the technology, unless  
it's really necessary.

Consistency does not necessarily equate to uniformity.  It depends on  
how much intelligence you put in the script.  In my opinion,  
consistency (to the rules you describe) is always desirable.  If  
uniformity doesn't suit, then the rules aren't complex enough.

Almost any decision you can make in Photoshop, you can make in a script.

With regards to paletting and compression, there are programs that  
can quickly experiment all combinations and return the best fit:  far  
quicker than a human designer can.

One objective is to put that power into the hands of the client.  By  
supplying an engine for them to produce their own content, you get  
them off your back.

Of course, this doesn't help if your primary objective is Jobs For  
The Boys, and not the good of the client.  I personally prefer to  
move on to more interesting new projects than dwell on old projects,  
even if they are cash-cows.

Incidentally, it's not about putting the designers out of business.   
It's about getting them to state design decisions clearly so we can  
adopt mass-production techniques.  That way, the designer can spend  
their time doing creative stuff, rather than monotonously churning  
out images.

In my experience, it also trims turnaround time on changes a great deal.

...and all those decisions you make in Photoshop (optical tracking,  
line spacing, colour palettes, compression) are subject to the  
personal aesthetic of the designer.  That is, unless the style guide  
you speak of is so incredibly specific, they have no decisions.  At  
which point, there's no reason why the style guide can't be encoded  
into a script.

And that's why I've never relied on FreeType's anti-aliasing.  I  
agree, it's unbelievably bad.  So, you render at four times (or more)  
the desired resolution and use a decent resampler to scale it down.

ImageMagick's inbuilt resampler gives far more flexibility than  
Photoshop.  Rather than "Nearest neighbour", "Bilinear", "Bicubic",  
"Bicubic (sharper)", "Bicubic (smoother)", you've got: Point, Box,  
Triangle, Hermite, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, Gaussian, Quadratic,  
Cubic, Catrom, Mitchell, Lanczos, Bessel, and Sinc.

I go one step further and use my own resampler which also supports  
LCD subpixel sampling if desired:

	http://gidden.net/tom/2006/05/29/lcd-resampling/

Nowadays, I'm secretly hoping to have the opportunity to build a site  
using Mac OS X, and letting Quartz do the image generation.  I think  
the advanced typography and image quality included in that wees on  
anything any other OS can do right now.

Believe it or not, Microsoft-hater that I am, I've written server- 
side ActiveX objects to do image generation including typography.   
FreeType, GD and (to an extent) ImageMagick are all written in  
portable C.  I've also written equivalent server-side Java objects  
using Java 2D to do the same thing.

Since the late nineties I've always used "Big Site" techniques to all  
sites, big or small, just because they serve all purposes and I only  
have to remember one technique.  Plus, you never know what the future  
might bring for any project.

Even when writing a small, one-shot static HTML site, I'll use the  
graphics generators and CMS techniques and then walk it with  
recursive Wget to generate the static HTML (which is why I use  
PATH_INFO instead of QUERY_STRING)

Of course, which is why I used plain text on the sidebar icons.

In the most recent site I did, we actually _didn't_ want the text  
accessible, and we specifically didn't include ALT tags.  The reason  
was that the title of the search result was the address of the house/ 
flat in question.  If the address was included in computer-readable  
format, then ripping off the database would be too easy!

In other sites, it's usually because the font required isn't  
available.  At that point, I'd use text-to-image replacement in  
Javascript (no idea what webmonkeys call it), but I'd get the  
Javascript to generate CSS rather than doing the mouse event switcheroo.

I never said what was in the html() method :)

In this particular case, it was capable of outputting a <ul>, or  
outputting Javascript Object Notation with an HTML wrapper to allow a  
client-side script to produce the required DOM objects.  You could  
also provide clean XML and let XSLT convert it into something usable.

The scripter (who wrote the above code) doesn't care how the  
SidebarButton object works... that's up to the programmer.  If  
anything, I overabstract stuff.

The usual approaches to semantic separation of markup and  
presentation tend to focus on client-side too often.  To do it  
properly, the entire system from the database through to the browser  
should be considered to be a very deep stack of abstraction layers.   
In a case like this, the markup/presentation divide may be apparently  
compromised as the abstraction is resolved before it gets to the  
browser.

This means you can then go back and change the topology of the page  
(not just the topography) very easily later, by amending the server- 
side objects.  This means you can output all sorts of different  
renderings of your site: including different forms of HTML (low- 
bandwidth, bare, NOSCRIPT, super-accessible, all-singing-all-dancing,  
Flash-including), PDFs, RTF docs for Word...

If done smart, the line between client-side and server-side can even  
be blurred a great deal:  one theme can output just HTML, another can  
output just the JS to build the whole page, and another can use AJAX  
to mix and match.  This can even occur within a page:  I had the  
first batch of search results written in HTML on most browsers, and  
in-page JSON in Gecko browsers with subsequent batches coming across  
JSON using XHR.

The widgets I wrote for the system (including Sidebar, SidebarButton,  
SearchResult, Page, ContentArea, Photo, etc.) were capable of  
serialising to all formats.

Anyway, back to the point.  If you were to use a plain UL with JS  
image replacement, you could still use a graphics generator sitting  
inside its own PHP script, which is referred to in the background- 
image: (or the <IMG SRC="">) URL.  In fact, since I abstracted all of  
this into objects, it was simple to supply these as well... useful  
when prototyping without a CMS.

There are a few problems with that "Just In Time" strategy, though:

Firstly, the images don't get generated until requested, leading to  
performance serialisation, even if caching is used (duh).  It also  
adds the overhead of PHP when a static file can be served (unless the  
ErrorDocument technique is used)

Secondly, the markup (be it HTML, JS, CSS or AJAX-retrieved XML or  
JSON) has no idea of image size on non-fixed-size images, so the  
layout can get funky.

As a result, I generate the images at page generation time and cache  
them.  The ImageProducer classes I wrote manage caching using a  
filesystem AND using Memcache.


Anyway, you're not really going to manage to get the images generated  
on the client-side, so it has to be done server-side.  Well, that's  
if you discount Flash (Pants) image replacement (yick yick yick) and  
SVG/Canvas (not really practical right now, although definitely fun  
to play with)

Right. *cough* IE *cough*

Seriously though, that's a silly comparison. CSS and JavaScript do different
things, and consequently have different issues. When it comes to rollovers,
though, one seems about as bulletproof/fragile as the other IME.

Dood, there is no program in the world to handle arbitrarily long text in an
arbitrary font at an arbitrary size. Not if design/image are primary aspects
of the project, and as we're a marketing firm they nearly always are for us.

Show me.

And these metacharacters understand that just because the 'it' /can/ fit on

Oh for the love of dog...graphic design is about making best use of the
medium to communicate. Web design is maybe a bit more involved in som ways--
there are different levels of communication, and more meta stuff happening
(communicating about the interface, the state of the system, etc.) too, but
it's the same sort of deal. And just as you don't use subtly-shaded
gradients when the job calls for printing on newsprint, you don't go
insisting on Gill Sans for 4000 (or whatever) headings on a web site. It's
just bad design.

Of course, I'm not especially fond of Gill Sans in the first place (shock!
horror!).

Show me.

Seriously -- that would be a very handy widget to have, and I'm sure
Panasonic, Canon, Nikon et al would be quite interested in something like
that if it could be made to run on a processor that would fit inside a DSLR.

Yes. But a wicked-complex set of scripts humming away may or may not be the
best way to accomplish that.

And there's that lil' ol' budget thing to consider, too.

Yes, *sob* I admit it. I'm just sitting here fleecing unwary clients for the
enrichment of my pals. Oh, the shame of it. How /do/ I sleep at night?

Or they can put down this month's /Wallpaper/, get a thorough briefing on
the requirements and goals of the project and do a proper *design*, instead
of merely decorating.

Wait -- no, we wouldn't want that. Then they might actually have to learn
something about their jobs, the poor dears.

Certain sorts of changes, absolutely. The trick is that any time you gain

To a point. But the wrong colour is the wrong colour. Piss-poor typesetting
is piss-poor typesetting. Excessive artifacting is excessive artifacting.

Either you have someone competent to do the work within the requirements of
the project -- and obviously what's 'good enough' for one isn't necessarily
so for another -- or you don't. If you don't, there are lots of ways to
solve the problem that don't necessarily involve writing a heap of scripts
(though they may).

That should help, but if the letterspacing's shite to begin with it'll still

Ya, I remember you posting the test page. Interesting experiment, but on my
PowerBook, at least, the P'shop 'sharper' version is hands-down the best for
detail -- stuff is visible in that one that isn't in the others. Of course,
a 'smoother' image may be aesthetically preferable in some circumstances.

Quite possibly, though with a properly-hinted ClearType font MS's ClearType
is pretty darned impressive.

And if there are 10 unique templates in a 20-page site, you've gained what,

I didn't know 'it would make our site too easy to rip off' was a defense in

I don't get it.

Are you saying writing style rules to a stylesheet is more reliable than an
onmouseover handler? I don't expect so, because that would be utter
bollocks.

So what then? If you're swapping classes about with JavaScript then the
script needs to know when to swap the classes. Which would mean an event
handler, which you've already dismissed as 'unreliable'. So that's not it.

And if you're just slapping the classes on the elements on-the-fly to avoid
having to put them in by hand, then except in very specific instances ('only
on the third H3 of each page' or 'only if the H2 is followed immediately by
a UL') I don't see how the script's going to find them if CSS selectors
cannot, so it would seem that the JS would be superfluous. So that's not it
either.

I really don't get it.

it's an ITT for www.uksg.org and details are here:

from what i can tell it's primarily a hosting and basic maintenance

Hey all,

I'm looking for a graphic designer to collaborate on some web  
projects and hopefully it'll work both ways. I've (with a bit of  
luck) got a couple of projects coming up where I'm going to need a  
designer in the near future and maybe there's a designer out there  
who could need the use of a developer!

Get in touch if you could be interested!

Cheers,

Good Afternoon Mr. McGregor

 

 

Thank you for your recent correspondence, please accept my apologies for 
the delay in replying to you.

 

I have looked in to the points raised and can confirm that we will be 
refunding you with the GBP 56 originally debited from your account.

 

I am very sorry for the service you have received and now having been 
charged for the stay. It seems that there has been a system error with 
the booking and therefore the reservation has been charged as a 'no 
show. Our hotels are required to advise us of such matters to ensure we 
do not charge reservations that are affected. In this instance it seems 
that this procedure was not adhered to and I would like to apologise for 
any inconvenience this may have caused.

 

I have now requested a refund for you and a receipt confirming this 
transaction will be sent to you within a separate letter.

 

I am very sorry again for the service you received at the hotel, I thank 
you for your comments and we will be looking into the experience you had 
whilst staying with us.

 

Of course I will be sending you a voucher for a free nights stay at any 
of our hotels across the country. I will send this in the post and it 
should reach you within the next few days.

 

Once again sorry for this matter, please accept my apologies on behalf 
of Travelodge I am sorry for the confusion caused and I hope we can look 
forward to welcoming you to one of our hotels in the near future.

 

Kind Regards,

Dear Sir/Madam,

 

I am writing in response to your letter dated 17th July 2006 with the

above Booking Reference Number.

 

This is a duplicate transaction as I did stay on the night in question

and have paid in full.

 

The night was most memorable as I was kept waiting for 20 minutes on

check-in.  Then on no less than three occasions was given a swipe card

that failed to open the room door.  Staff then escorted me to the room

and opened the door whereby we were met by the angry shouts of a large

naked man.  I was then presented with another card and room.  On falling

to sleep I was awoken by a guest entering my room, then 5 minutes later

by reception staff 'just checking'.

 

You have 7 days to refund ?56.00 to my account.

 

As a gesture of goodwill I suggest you offer me a free nights

accommodation in a Travelodge of my choice.

 

Yours Sincerely,

 

Andrew McGregor

It was me - I got my money back - but they didn't give me a voucher - 
the buggers - did you ask for one?

I should have given them some more hell.

Anyway - that's what happened to me - their computer booking system was 
so slow, by the time I got to London the day after I booked, the 
reservation wasn't there yet.

GRRRRRRRRRR!!!!

paid a deposit and got email confirmation of my booking of a "Premier Room"
in Feb. (they even have a 3D view of the room on their site)

When I turned up they gave me a broom cupboard and expected me to pay the
same rate. They refused to do anything about it and they'd already taken a
card impression when I checked in so they weren't bothered.

Unfortunately for them my card went *missing* and I had to cancel it with
immediate effect. So I walked out on Sunday refusing to pay and on Monday
they tried to put the full amount through. It was declined. Tossers

Still not heard from them

My brother had an almost identical experience with a hotel near Cork,  
except he'd given his card details on their website. When he turned  
up it was totally different than described. Even the photos showing  
the "sea view" were taken several miles away. When he arrived he told  
them no bloody way was he staying there and cancelled the booking.  
They said they would charge him for the full weekend, so he went off  
to a lovely hotel he found nearby. Somehow he managed to "lose" his  
card in the process.

I think it really stinks that it's possible for these people to take money
out of your account without your permission (in fact the exact opposite).
Des any one know what the legal situation is if someone takes money from
your card against your wishes.

Obviously it's better not to let them get at the money in the first place.

I find banks are quite accommodating with getting your money back  
from a bad charge.  I had an e-shop in germany charge me 4 times, and  
wouldn't answer my emails, so I called smile and had them refund the  
money.  Then got an angry letter from some debt collectors who tried  
to charge me ?100 x 3 for fees and admin, but this was a few months  
after my card had naturally lived out its life.

As long as you can prove they charged you for something you didn't  
order, such as a room that doesn't exist, the bank will fight it for  
you.

Sure.  Of course, they're designed for different things, which is why  
I don't really like using JS to do styling stuff (eg. rollovers) when  
they can be done with CSS.  Even if the JS is needed for text  
removal, etc., I personally prefer to do the actual implementation  
using the semantically-appropriate ":hover", rather than mouse events.

In my experience, I've had JS-based (eg. image preloading) rollovers  
fail, thanks to weird code in the rest of the page (both mine and  
others'), so I'm not a big fan.  At least :hover rollovers tend to  
fail gracefully (ie. just fails to work without interrupting anything  
else)

I try not to do page styling in Javascript, unless the equivalent CSS  
is really gruesome... it just seems hacky.

At the very least, the Javascript used should be abstracted in the  
CMS (eg. using a "Rollover" object), so it can be replaced en masse  
easily.

Incidentally, one reason I don't like it is that it makes the code  
less transformable... I worked for a while on a project that would  
require an HTTP-and-HTML-to-something-else converting transparent  
proxy/gateway, and Javascript stuff was the bit that couldn't be  
translated on-the-fly.

The clean declarative nature of CSS (minus all the browser-specific  
peculiarities) is a lot easier to translate into "something else"  
than a bunch of Javascript.

De facto standard libraries and approaches help as you can put in a  
special-case filter for Javascript that is clearly widespread cookie- 
cutter, but that's just a hack.

Erm.. yes.  A lot.  I've also worked on brand manual projects.

I'm not suggesting that the theme be user-definable or anything like  
that.  A theming engine can come in handy when generating different  
output forms (eg. WML, HTML, PDF), and especially for rebranding  
exercises.

Maybe "theming" is the wrong word, although it works in such a  
similar way to theming and skinning in other systems.

What I mean is that all presentation (including the graphics used) is  
abstracted completely into an isolated and switchable module.  An  
external CSS file is about as simplistic as this gets, but I would  
also say that the theme module should be capable of filtering and  
altering the information sent to the browser, and thus must be server- 
side.  My concept of a theming engine supplies (and sometimes  
creates) the CSS, the images, and to an extent the layout (whether to  
divide into pages or not).

I never said that it handles arbitrarily long text in an arbitrary  
font and an arbitrary size:  these are tools that I configure for the  
given scenario within the constraints of the design.

I think it's possible to write code to make good decisions about  
typographical layout, based on rules that the designer lays down, but  
still have a way to manually tweak without interrupting the workflow  
(ie. starting up Photoshop)

I've been working on non-public (eg. intranet and extranet) sites for  
a long time now, so I've got nothing online that demonstrates this at  
the moment.

No, but there's no reason why rules like that couldn't be written  
in.  Look at some of the things that decent hyphenation engines can do.

Anyway, that's not what I'm describing. The metacharacters are there  
to allow the content creator (sometimes the designer) to override the  
default choices.  This way, the system defaults to uniformity, but  
allows tweaking without having to start up Photoshop and interfere  
with a well-oiled automated workflow.

Which is why that subclass was for page titles for a specific site  
using a specific font!  However, you can subclass it with *different*  
rules for different fonts.

I personally believe in scripting everything beyond the most trivial  
site, using a set of standard tools where possible.  It's served me  
well over the years, especially when the client changes their mind.

Erm.. okay.  Screw you.

I was merely using a real-world example of how this technique is useful.

The site in question was the NHS website back in 1997 (or early 1998?  
Can't remember), and we had to conform to a fixed style guide, which  
included headings in Gill Sans.  I was NOT the designer for this  
project, nor the producer, but I think the designers that worked on  
the project did a spectacular job.  The design decision to use  
generated graphics for headings was correct for this project, and  
compromising that would have been a shame.

These techniques allowed me to implement the site as designed with NO  
compromises or mistakes, and it came in on time (with a *very* tight  
deadline) and under budget and was a real success.

[Oh, and tell The Sunday Times not to use subtle gradients on  
newsprint.  The paper's covered with them!  Incidentally, I want to  
make it clear that I have never bought a single copy of The Sunday  
Times or any of its stablemates. I just know people who have. :)

I'm not suggesting a generic all-powerful program to make the decisions.

I have my own code that implement these (bolting together stuff like  
PNGCrush, along with homegrown comparisons), but I don't know of any  
off-the-shelf and ready to use.  I haven't used DeBabelizer in over a  
decade, but that might do the trick.  It looks like they've done a  
server-side version too now.

The thing is, I'm not expecting the program to make a subjective  
decision... merely to provide a framework by which I can state my  
wishes as precisely as I can.  The "Best fit" I talk about is the  
best fit to the constraints described by the programmer (from the  
designer's instruction).

So, for example, I could choose which resampling filter works best  
for a given style of menu button, and then let it run.  If it's not  
quite right, I can always rerun the batch with different parameters.

Anyway, Panasonic, Canon, Nikon et al, would be more interested in a  
JPEG compressor, which is a far more subjective issue.

Well, if you've got these kind of things in your toolkit and you know  
how to use them, I believe it's far more efficient than spazzing out  
on unnecessary manual effort.

Fine...  Just don't expect me to applaud that attitude as best practice.

I like to deliver to the client as cheaply and quickly as I can and  
deliver a product better than they were expecting.  I can deliver  
value-for-money by making the process efficient.  I've found  
automated scripted procedures and workflows a great way of doing this.

I prefer to hand over and move onto new projects, rather than having  
to do day-to-day maintenance, and I think it's a *little* dishonest  
to keep charging top-dollar for maintenance when it's practical to  
offer them a system they can maintain themselves (at least for day-to- 
day stuff)

Some of the designers I've worked with (including one or two who are  
still on this list) are really world-class.  My point was that I'd  
prefer to see a designer coming up with great designs, rather than  
ploughing through ImageReady for hours, days or weeks.

They quickly learned that their time was far better spent coming up  
with great designs and then passing them off to a programmer to  
script up, rather than having to sit around chopping images up for  
weeks on end.

In one of the first commercial web projects I worked on, the designer  
had done a wonderful set of designs in the first month, and then  
spent two or three months cropping out hundreds of little text  
images.  Due to the monotonous nature of the task, he made some  
mistakes, and sometimes used misleading filenames, making the use of  
these images tedious.

Then, when the client changed his mind on the design, he had to do  
the whole lot again.  Then, it turned out the font size was wrong, so  
he had to do it *again*.  After a few rounds of this, I started to  
put together a graphics generator to do it.  Much easier after  
that... he just supplied me with his spec and some sample images, and  
I coded it up.

This was back in Netscape 2.0 days, so nice pretty CSS typography  
wasn't possible.

I've found that once you've got the tools, this technique is so easy,  
it's not worth doing the manual way.  Photoshop's a fantastic tool  
for doing the initial concept work and then mockups, along with the  
traditional tasks of image retouching, etc., but I see Photoshop as a  
craftsman's tool rather than a mass-production tool.  It's akin to  
sculpting a concept car by hand, and then using a robotic factory for  
all production models.

With web work, I've found that the factory's pretty damn quick to set  
up once you've done it enough times.  Sometimes that time is  
recovered in the first iteration.

I'm sorry, I just don't accept that.

Yes, but it's relatively easy for a designer new to the project to  
put their own spin on things and get it wrong.  It's also easy for an  
experienced but tired designer on a deadline to slip and get the  
colour correction profile wrong or something like that and fail to  
test it on PC or Mac.

I've had to correct colour profiles, slightly mis-cropped images,  
spelling mistakes, inconsistent colour depth, etc. on stuff coming  
out from really top-notch designers.  People make mistakes.   
Automation tends to prevent mistakes... and when it does screw up, it  
tends to be pretty obvious.

Automation allows them to make decisions and then have them followed  
meticulously by labour-saving devices (scripts).  I specifically  
don't want a smart program making those decisions for me: just one  
that follows the rules I give it, and then lets me spend my time  
doing something else.

Plus, I like leaving a project knowing the client can pick it up  
where I left off without having to employ someone else just to churn  
out amendments.

Yeah, that was the point I was making.  If you've hypothetically got  
an precise enough style guide to prevent deviation, then a lot of it  
could be scripted.

Of course, that's not usually possible (apart from a very content- 
heavy site, where you just set down a draconian style and let the  
subtleties go, in favour of ease-of-publication)

So, you've going to risk deviation, sometimes by accident, and  
sometimes thanks to the new designer having a different take on  
things.  Fine.  A really good designer can make gradual improvements  
while still keeping consistent with an existing set-down style, if  
necessary by freshening everything up at once (another thing  
scripting helps with).  To minimise the amount of deviation (or just  
plain mistakes), the noddy stuff (resizing, compressing, choice of  
palette, file location, uploading, revision control, etc) can be  
scripted.

Yeah.. that reply was with regards to your point about the anti- 
aliasing. :)

FreeType doesn't do well with badly kerned fonts, but it's got  
better.  I tend to prefer the Type-1 font functions rather than  
TrueType, as I tend to think the calibre of font implementation is  
better with T1.

> And the script can figure out which is best, huh?

Oh, FFS, No.  (Although you *can* script it to compare how accurate  
it is in comparison to the original, but that's a bit too basic.)

These tools are there for the programmer to select from, to implement  
the designer's intentions.  Once, I wrote a theme editor for the  
designer to use which offered these options in a dropdown box, with  
notes explaining the pros and cons for each.  He was effectively  
using that theming tool to build script recipes.

This was for a project that required the user's own company branding  
to integrate with the site design:  the top navigation and page title  
would use that company's branding.  We had about 600 companies to do,  
and the title bars could contain just about any arbitrary English  
text (addresses, customer names, event titles, etc.).  This  
translated to potentially tens of millions of title graphics, and  
probably 10,000 themed icon graphics.

For the titles, we needed pretty comprehensive text-shrinking rules  
(rather than just "keep shrinking till it fits"), reasonably powerful  
composition and alignment, character spacing (which *could* be  
overridden for some of the more common page titles, not addresses)

This system didn't take me to write... not because of my manliness or  
geekiness, but because IT'S REALLY NOT VERY DIFFICULT!

I got varying opinions on this (not just on Underscore), and I just  
don't think there's a right answer on this one.  Some people agree  
with you, and some people preferred the LCD'ed images.  It was, as  
you say, an experiment, and it didn't use a good enough resampling  
matrix.  Next time I need the subpixelling, I'll improve the filter.

The main reason for writing that was out of necessity to make the  
16x16 icons legible.  The client (my boss) wanted *everything* on  
screen at once, and there was little hope in persuading him.  He  
wanted text links everywhere, as he didn't "get" icons.  I managed to  
persuade him that most people comprehend colours and shapes before  
reading text, and so allow icons, but there was no space for anything  
bigger than about 16x16.

After using that resampler, the majority (probably only about 60-70%)  
opinion was that the LCD'ed icons were more legible than the  
Photoshop equivalents.

I ended up not using it anyway, because the design was changed to  
include a gradient background for the sidebar, and it's actually  
*impossible* to get a pre-sampled subpixel antialiased PNG to  
composite correctly against an arbitrarily coloured background.   
That's why I didn't bother improving the filtering algorithm.

It's a very subjective thing...  I personally dislike Microsoft's  
rasterizers:  too pixelly and not close enough to the original  
shape.  I find even ClearType'd text too distorted and ugly, thanks  
to Microsoft's heavy-handed approach to hinting. I don't really like  
the effect of strong hinting, and would prefer blurry to distorted.   
I mean, small scale Verdana, Arial, etc. don't look anything like the  
ideal outlines, even in weight consistency.

As far as I know, the Cocoa rasterizer doesn't use hinting much, if  
at all, as it does a good enough job without it.  I even prefer the  
one colour iPods use (although I seem to remember that's a hack using  
pieced-together glyph bitmaps, but I might be wrong)

Adobe's was good (especially the one in Acrobat Reader), but I still  
like OS X's one... especially when you feed it something like Zapfino  
with its amazing advanced ligature support :)

The FreeType default rasterizer is very similar to the old (non- 
Cleartype) Microsoft one.  They're both ghastly: they tend to add  
smoothing pixels, but don't remove them, and curves end up too  
flattened just to avoid the dreaded staircasing.

To be honest, I even think the old Acorn RISC OS rasterizer (circa  
1989) was better in some ways than the old Microsoft one.

I do admit that the techniques are of *less* use than on non- 
brochureware, but they're still often pretty handy.

Yes, it's not as practical to use specific page templates, but you  
can still get some wins by using the techniques in more self- 
contained ways... especially when it comes to consistent navigation.

Agreed, brochureware is a very different beast, and I've been  
recently concentrating more on other types of site, but I've got some  
experience with them.  In fact, I originally started using these  
techniques while working on marketing projects and outright  
brochureware.

I've found that there are some automation techniques that can still  
be pretty handy even with image-centric sites... especially when it  
comes to post-processing, in fact.

Plus, things like revision control and release management (even for  
images) are useful in *any* size of project, but they're often seen  
as "big project" techniques.

Yeah.. it was a strange and difficult call (incidentally, not made by  
myself).  This was a closed-user-group site with very restrictive  
membership requirements, which mitigated the issue a little bit.  We  
also had the capability to set a given user to use a more accessible  
theme, although if ever needed, we'd watch their account usage *very*  
carefully.

The database itself represented a major (if not majority) chunk of  
the company's worth.  There were a lot of potential vultures who  
really wanted that data.  Anyway, the decision paid off.  We noticed  
an organised attempt to steal data made by the 800-pound gorilla of  
the industry sector, which was exactly what we feared.  The data  
wasn't any use to them without the addresses, and we'd made those  
effectively unrippable (as I wouldn't think that gorilla would have  
any idea about OCR)

If there was any other practical way of protecting the data, we would  
have used it.



Anyway, I'm dropping this thread now.  I'm secure in the knowledge  
that I'm not too bad at this stuff, and this would probably just  
descend further into bickering from here.

Hi All,

Morning all,

Right, hope I am not going to get my ehad blown off for asking this,
but who offers their clients a google analytics based report, and if
so do you charge?

Analytics is great I think, and none of my clients know about it or
would be able to implement it, but is it right charging them for it?
It is time after all, and time is money. If you do charge them, I
would love to hear how much and what you include, presumably for a
monthly report?

Also, for those who may use other stats programmes, do tell, we mas as
well all learn something from you today!

I have been using Internet Business Promoter 8 for some SEO work and it has
a report generator that can be customised to include your own branding.
Although I haven't used this feature, it might be worth a look as an
alternative if this is the sort of thing you use.

Also, if you have the text log files, Funnel Web Analyser from Quest

report by default but I seem to remember you can output it in different

Might be worth checking out seeing as it's free!

Hi [_]

I'm looking for a good bug tracking system suitable for web applications,
that is simple enough for non-technical people to add bugs, yet usable
enough so that I can generate nice reports that prove to myself that
progress is being made. I'm tempted by trac, but it seems to be integrated
quite well with subversion which we don't use. Bugzilla seems a bit overkill
for smaller projects and I have yet to find any others that look really good
for dropping into the web workflow.

Links:

http://www.bugzilla.org/
http://trac.edgewall.org/


Ideas?

Plus, has anyone had any experience of Selenium tests (
http://www.openqa.org/selenium/)

Cheers,
Dan

We use Jira, they do free open source licenses and relatively cheap
commercial ones. Its been worth its weight in gold for us. Its more than
just bug tracking if you want it to be, almost a light weight project
tracking tool, but without complicating the interface unnecessarily. There
is an SVN plugin available and it also integrates with the Wiki tool from
the same house.

eh? are you saying you can't use subversion for Plone development? That
might be the case if you do everything within the ZMI, but not if you follow
best practice and develop on the filesystem - then you can use subversion.

But there's substance *and* style there - no warning necessary.

Blimey - I know there's a backlash on and everything, but can people
not see past the sites with no business model and/or purpose and/or
innovation to see the really useful stuff out there that (for better
or worse) are "a bit Web 2.0"?

Healthy scepticism is good, but there's too many good babies (Flickr,
del.icio.us, etc etc) to throw the entire bathwater out.

By on the filesystem, do you mean just creating a filesystem folder,  
and pulling in real files?  That's all well and good, but you don't  
get the catalogue or any of the internal plone content structure in  
it.  Maybe I'm just misunderstanding, but it seems much easier just  
to keep regular export backups of the whole plone instance.

Most DVI monitors will accept VGA input - but not the recent set of panels
from Apple. I wanted to do the same thing for display screens at Watershed,
but thankfully checked the DVI plug before buying 3 24" monitors!

You can tell if a DVI plug/socket supports analog signals by looking at the
"long straight" pin - if it's surrounded by 4 small pins, it supports
analog. If not, it's digital only. The studio monitors I looked at were
DVI-D (DVI-A being analog only, and DVI-I being both).

Apologies...

I was not commenting on the Web 2.0ness(?) of it because I have  
anything specific against it.
I was anticipating a backlash myself, so I thought it would be a good  
idea to add in a little warning, that way people don't assume I  
mentioned it because it hits all the right buzzwords.

I agree that rich client applications do have their place, and there  
are some very good ones around, such as the two you mentioned.

(And I was being cheeky.)

Nevermind.. you mean using the filesystem interfaces to the ZODB,  
don't you?  I'm still caffeine deprived.  Didn't think of using a  
versioning system via that, interesting idea.

No, he meant if you are doing development, say a Plone skin or product 
to do that on the filesystem and then version control that with SVN and 
the likes.  Makes is much easier for testing etc.

Content is a whole different ballgame :)  VC systems like SVN would not 
be all that efficient or useful for version control of complex objects 
as it would have to know the specifics of the objects in order to diff 
them usefully.  Yes you could store pickles blobs in SVN but that isn't 
that useful.  If you want to do version control of content in Plone you 
want to look at something like CMFEditions.

Ah right, well of course for products, that's hardly zope/plone, it's  
just python.

I wonder whether creators of genuinely useful online apps will have to
start a new lo-fi, gradient-less aesthetic in order to not appear to
be all style and no substance.

I could have mentioned many more, if I'd taken time to think about it.
GMail, MeasureMap, 43[Places|Things|People], DevShop (private beta
starts today - hurrah!), even Amigo (Carson Systems' new "have
hay/want hay" app for matching advertisers to email newsletters).

Sturgeon's law applies as much (moreso?) in Web 2.0 land as anywhere,
though. Most of the really innovative stuff already happened; so may
people think that making *yet another* online calendar app With
Tagging (TM) will earn them oodles of VC or a big corporate buyout.
"Building to flip" is the term.

ahem... what about ZPT! that's zope innit? I mainly do Plone skinning work,
and I live mainly in the template and CSS layers and I do it all as
filesystem based installable products, version controlled by SVN. I don't
actually know much python, but if I did i'd be damn sure to use SVN for that
too ;-)

Morning All,

 Right, scenario for you: I have a product/service for which I would
like to charge ?1, and ?1 only. May not seem like worth the trouble,
but its quantity I am after. Now I know they could send me a cheque,
(although bank fees would probably be more than that), and they could
"drop in" a coin, but I am wondering what other methods I could offer
them. I know you can take payments via SMS billing, so for those of
you who have experience in this, recommend away! Key here is not to be
charged much at all in exchange for taking the payment as little of
the ?1 may be left in the end!

 Thanks

Given what Zope (2) is like, I don't think I'd call it "just python"

We use Jira, they do free open source licenses and relatively cheap
commercial ones. Its been worth its weight in gold for us. Its more than
just bug tracking if you want it to be, almost a light weight project
tracking tool, but without complicating the interface unnecessarily.
There is an SVN plugin available and it also integrates with the Wiki
tool from the same house.

I think the issue at large is one of people writing 'web 2.0' off as
useless because many of them dont actually realise they are using web
2.0 applications in the vast majority of cases.

Ive lost count the number of people Ive seen on mailing lists saying
Web 2.0 sucks and yet they are posting from a gmail account, or have
discussed integration with Google Maps indepth et al.

And if you are using Plone then there is a handful for it, including Poi:

Also, there are plenty of outsourced online ones, things like 
sourceforge, basecamp etc.

I've always maintained that the buzzword sucks, not the technology.
Buzzwords always seem to lead to a misunderstanding of what the technology
actually is. Web 2.0 to many people means rounded corners and glassy looking
gradients!

"It's not a technology, it's a new way of thinking" or something.

If you put ten web devs in a room and asked them what Web 2.0 is,
you'd likely get ten different answers.

Firstly, you did give them your card details and you did
also authorize them to take money from your account.

Granted you only told them to take it once, but billing systems are not
perfect and mistakes are made. This is why you get a statement - which
you are supposably checking.

If it was on a credit card and you take it up with the credit card
company they will sort it out for you. If it's a standard bank card
you may have less luck though. The credit card market is a little
more cut throat than high street banking and they'll do more to keep
you on as a customer.

Obviously, you can just file for the small claims court online and
if they've taken money for a night you didn't stay and didn't ask
to stay then you'll almost certainly win the money back and the
court costs. Then again going to court is not 100% certain so there
is an element of risk - but I don't think it's high.

Steps to take:
1) ring the card issuer and complain that an unauthorized transaction
has taken place - they do get quite a lot of these and will look into
it.

2) If you get here then put more pressure on the card issuer.

3) Money is returned to your account and charges will go away if there
were any - you might lose 50p on interest and them not doing sums quite
right or you might have made a little profit, but it's going to take
WAY more time to sort out (more than a few hours work) to regain the
?60 or so that such places charge. It's worth it, but not really
financially worth it unless you are underpaid with lots of free time!

This is a sad state of affairs, but as the card issuer or backer will
want to be damn sure they get it right before reclaiming the money
off the acquirer it won't always be quick unless your card company 
already really like you, in which case they'll probably refund you
first and then look into it. Or just write it off, which is more
likely for ?60.

Yes, but just having the idea that there is any sort of "web 2.0" thing
shows a complete lack of understanding of the difference between the
marketing of the industry and the industry itself. It beggars
belief that technical people take the term seriously enough as to
even comment on it.

/me too

And at the time people started AOLisms that was for them a 2.0 experience
of sorts. It's just made up and untrue. Like people who say "the new
breed of ..." insert anything.

It's about perception of technology, and that's probably quite important
from a sales point of view, but technologically web 2.0 is pants.

invisible non-existant vapourware pants.

Paypal is probably as good (and cheap) as anything for this kind of  
thing. Lots and lots of ?1 payments and you won't get charged a great  
deal overall.

I think you should set up a small shop somewhere and have a strange
looking person on the counter and a big "everything is ?1" sign outside.

Works for so many others, good example on crow lane in henbury, and
I think there's a few up gloucester road and one down in the shopping
area in bedminster - in case you're in bristol.

But if you really must do it online *groan* you could just use paypal
it's always going to cost you to do it, just how much hassle you want
is how much you'll make in profit - because otherwise you're just
paying someone else to do it.

P.S. It's Friday. I can't help it.

Why? There is a genuine difference in philosophy behind the apps of
2004 onwards vs the last bubble. APIs, rich UIs, Web standards,
user-generated content, collaboration, community as a side-effect
rather than as an aim, user-owned data etc. etc.

Really? Google maps is functionally indistinguishable from MapQuest?

I disagree. Some (most) manifestations of web 2.0 are indeed pants,
but the concept itself, IMHO, isn't.

GMail. Flickr. del.icio.us. All of them (and others) let you take your
data with you should you decide to leave, or the app folds. It
increases user trust, y'see, one of those philosophical differences to
bubble 1.0...

Not really. They're marketed differently, but the sort of philosophy
you are talking about was around well before the term "web 2.0" was
coined or became popular. It might not have been so fashionable, but
naming it like some new thing doesn't make a lot of sense at a
technincal level.

> >/me too

Yet, I'm commenting on it too. I thought that was slightly ironic, in
a sort of new AOL user on the 'net sort of way. I'm the eternal n00b.

No, but it's like "the new breed of supercar", yes, technology is slowly
improving but there was no real step up except for those so caught up
in now that they fail to see that in the bigger picture it's just terminology
for those who need to be buzzword compliant rather than realising that
it's just evolution. And this was no giant leap but a long slow evolution
that we're talking about.

The concept is about how people perceive the technology, not the
technology itself. Therefore it's a term describing peoples feelings
towards something. It's not anything in itself, especially not technically.

Yes. They're great, but web 2.0 still does not actually exist except
as a concept in the minds of a troubled few. :) You won't convince me
and maybe I won't convince you, but in ten years we'll look back and
I'm willing to bet that most people won't know or care what web 2.0
was. Except those with an almost religious faith in it. It's as ridiculous
as saying "spirituality" or religion is on the up. The talk maybe up
but nothing changed.

there's probably the usual kall kwik type affairs, but any  
recommendations would be appreciated!

At the risk of starting an argument, I actually use vistaprint... Got loads
of business cards, printed full colour, both sides, for next to nothing...
and as long as you have done the prrof yourself, its all easy!

I like S P Press, based in Cheddar (might be a bit out the way).

Call 01934 744568 and ask for John.

They can coat your business cards to make them feel silky, and round  
off corners, if your into that kind of thing.

Half-right: technology -- and more importantly, the understanding thereof --
has slowly improved to reach an arbitrary point of sophistication which has
been dubbed 'Web 2.0'.

Nobody likes to admit they were wrong. 'Web 2.0' is a way for folks to
acknowledge that their approach to the medium was wrong without having to
admit they didn't really 'get' the web for the first 10 years or take
responsibility for the bollacks they talked or the barely-functional (at
best) crap they built.

I don't know about the "half right" above, I'm not sure which half you
are referring to. I think I'm completely right too you see. :)

Strangely though I was just on the phone to someone and described it
almost exactly as above. It's as if all the people who sold rubbish
corporate brochureware for a decade need something new to sell.

No one out of the field of web design cares about web2.0 unless they
were told to by all those people who had the equipment but only
the nouse to do the corporate brochureware. It's like a really bad
excuse for ten years crap web design! Claim it's new and we weren't
able to do it before. Even if it was due to so many rubbish web
developers with no skills in bedrooms and eventually small offices
thinking they were the next big thing in the really big industry
of electronic glossy pamphlets.

Interesting to see who is pushing it so hard. :)

Meh.  It's really a pretty dumb name for one of those hand-waving  
concepts that's hard to put a good name to.

I mean, there are a number of other incremental improvements to the  
web which are of equivalent or greater magnitude, such as the  
addition of images, or the addition of scripting.

In terms of changes to the information supply, the biggest change has  
been the conversion from static (badly) hand-written HTML, to  
databases and CMSes.  That's a real shift.

To me, Web 2.0 is like saying a new car is a paradigm shift or a new  
generation of automotive excellence, just because it has cup- 
holders.  Yeah, cup-holders are great, but we should get this into  
perspective.

With regards to Web 2.0 referring to user-generated content,  
collaboration, etc., I don't think that really qualifies as a major  
innovation.  Active user-generated content and collaboration has the  
same, if not a longer history on the Internet than one-way  
publishing, thanks to USENET, BBSes and mailing lists.

So what if it's finally been made mainstream?  It's not like web- 
based BBSes haven't existed since the mid-nineties.  Hell, some of  
the old MUDs included "user-generated content" to the point that Joe  
Q. Mudder was creating whole cities of rooms for others to play in.

"AJAX", as a term, is slightly less bilious to me, as although it's a  
fairly stupid initialism, it actually labels a (minor) but non- 
negligible addition to the web toolkit: that of asynchronous content  
communication and the destruction of the "page".

I have no problem with a lot of the stuff that's released under the  
moniker "Web 2.0" -- GMail and Google Maps are pretty great -- but  
it's really not that big a deal.

I'm also thoroughly sick of rounded corners, gradient backgrounds,  
humanist fonts, and punning names in big, friendly letters on the  
cover.  I'm starting to pine for sharp edges, serifs and good old 18%  
grey.

Hi,
    I used these guys. http://www.castleprint.co.uk/ and they did a
fantastic job and charged ?170 + vat when the locals wanted 240 + vat! my
card is two sided 400 gsm laminated and colour both sides. If you want a
sample let me know.

Best regards,

Peter

Hmm,  the time has come to try and solve this once and for all.

I have, on my home system, something like 6 external disks totalling
1.8TB utilising firewire and usb external interfaces and PATA and SATA
internal interfaces.

As you can imagine this has devolved into a wiring nightmare, so I
have started looking into consolidation.  I dont want to REPLACE my
storage, so buying more large disks in an already completed solution
is not viable.

Can anyone recommend, on a budget of about ?100 or less, a way of
consolitating drives into one case with one power supply - im not
bothered about RAID or anything like that.

Help?

Experience has shown that the most cost effictive solution is an
empty cupboard. You could up the ante and buy a rack, but it'll
never be big enough and now and then the whole thing will probably
go live and try and kill you.

You got the 'technology evolving' bit in your email, but in that one didn't
mention anything about the understanding part.

Oddly enough, I keep *trying* to inject some interest into sites we do, but
in many cases it's the clients who push back. They really just want a glossy
brochure -- anything more sounds like far too much work and/or too
dangerous. :-/

Its the wall warts that are the main issue here - each one of them
converts down and wastes electricity in the process, especially since
it only allows a certain ampage through.

Wont they draw their power from the hub instead of requiring their

Only 2.5" notebook drives are low-power enough to get their power from the
bus.

You could rig up a cheap PSU (20 quid or less from Dabs et al) and then use
the 4-pin molex connectors in your drives. You can get splitters too, so one
PSU could easily power 6 drives. PSU then plugs into the mains, same as a
computer does.

This is assuming, of course, you can dismantle all your cases and have the
drives still plugged in to the FW/USB bridge when using a different power
supply.

Only because it's like people with zimmer frames talking about
skiing technique, or people who take too much interest in football
and actually care for the names of the people who play in some team
that they've only ever seen on the telly and don't live near.

Fanatical supporters is what I'm talking of, and the web has way
way too many of them.

The understanding is so missing for so many people
the term itself is just frightening. I like the idea of slapping
anyone with a wet haddock who even says "web 2.0", credits to
Keith Jones for that one. :)

In a sense web2.0 is here when it sells, and it'll be the people who pay
for it who decided what it is. Especially in such a grovelling client
satisfying industry as web design. (Yes, yes, I know but it's not like
selling cars where the salesmen often just slag you off and play games like
"ooh you couldn't afford that sir", far too much web work seems to be
giving in, because like everyone else in a flooded industry that's the
only way you'll get the clients.

I'd beg to differ, but then I've read too many oreally books too. In
fact all technical publishing houses seems to cater for these days are
teach yourself * in x days|weeks|hours. Oreally are just as bad, except
in a few rare, older cases. IMHO of course, but then I never buy
technical books except in subjects I really need help learning at such
a basic or if you find a really good book, intermediate, level.

It's arrogant friday today anyway so I'll leave that paragraph there :)

I have quite a few old PSU's, which are all pretty much silent, but lack the
little four pin plug thing that I need to use them with any of the systems I
have. Should be useful for this type of use though. If you want one, just
let me know and I will bring it to work (Baldwin Street) on Monday.

I've got purchase approval from the wife for a couple of new 19inch TFT's,

I'm currently tempted for a couple of wide screen's, so that I can flip
them sideways for programing -  but I've not had any experience of
gaming on them, any problems generally?

The resolution for them is 1440 x 900 WXGA, how well supported is that
in general for loud shooty type games?

to preempt a little,  (hey, this is underscore)
    1: no I don't want one big one in stead, I've got a nice telly for
the consoles & dvd  to go on
    2: it's for a PC, no I don't want a mac. (or a laptop)

Pretty awful. I play most games at 1280x1024 because that's the best that'll
fit on my 1680x1050 laptop screen - but even then the aspect ratio is sometimes
wrong.

There are a couple of good games that do work, but check the games you will
be wanting to play first.

Well, there's Frappr.com (not sure if you can use postcodes - you may
need to convert to lat/long first).

Depends on the game, but I enjoy all the usual suspects (Half Life 2, 
Counter Strike Source, FEAR, World of Warcraft, Oblivion, Sin EP1, etc) 
in proper wide-screen mode on my 20.1" Belinea (1680x1050), they look

'modern' ones will though without the usual pixel stretching.

Message-ID: <30add60608040854g6ba6b428j467325be48d3452b@mail.gmail.com>

Afternoon all,

Right I am starting a project for a client, who seems a little lost
when it comes to control panel and ftp logins and other information to
make a start on their website rebuild.

Basically their site is currently hosted by a company called
something4.co.uk and they are using an ecommerce package called
Cyrane. Anybody heard of it?

Now I am a php/MySQL man myself, and this is all asp. There is talk
from the client that the data of products for the site is sitting on
two computers at their office, which i find hard to believe.
What I need to know is that if asp sites accessible like php/MySQL
sites are. I.E will there be a username/password access to a control
panel where I can do an export of the database to then convert and re
import back into a MySQL database?

Any help and light anyone can shed about this migration would be great.

Thanks,

Duncan

Ask your client to login to their control panel to show you. I would be 
very surprised if your client had access to either the ASP source code, 
or the database his products are being stored in, because it *sounds* 
like a proprietary system to me. Having said that, the something4.co.uk 
doesn't resolve for me, so that's just a guess.

If it's a hosted solution, the control panel offers no data export 
facility, and the host won't play ball in releasing the data to you - 
then I'd say you're a bit SOL and should consider either some kind of 
'screen scraper' to get the data back, or see if your client would mind 
re-entering it (depending on volume of products, I've no idea if this is 
feasible)

Cheers,

Rich

The scary thing is, the above spec (and mine for that matter.. AMD 
Athlon FX-62 / 2GB Corsair / 7950 SLI) still won't be able to push the 
game in fully 'maxed out' settings!! But you're right, we can at least 
still play it looking nice :)

Not sure it'll come within your ?100 budget but how about a PC case and some
bridgeboards like these: http://tinyurl.com/z2u92

You'd still have a few usb/firewire cables about but certainly less power
bricks.

ASP can be used with a number of different databases, including MySQL but is
most commonly for this type of thing MS Access or MS SQL. If it is Access
then you should be able to ftp the. mdb file down, and do some kind of
export locally. This makes sense if the client claims they have the database
in their office because maybe they update the database locally and ftp the
.mdb file up to the server? just a guess. It is perfectly possible that your
client runs a database server in their office that the ASP connects to, if
they have a leased line or something - that is more likely to be MS SQL
though as you can't connect to an Access DB like that.

To do an export on MS SQL you would need some kind of client (such as SQL
server console or db artrisan) to connect to it and do a SQL dump.

If it is either Access or MS SQL there are a number of utilities that will
let you export the table data into a format suitable to be imported into
MySQL, but both Access and MSSQL have functionality (such as views and
stored procedures) that MySQL doesn't* so you won't necessarily be able to
export that

* yep I know MySQL 5 has stored procedures or something?

Subject: [_] Needed - php Superman/woman with an interest in global issues
Message-ID: <44D4702D.6080508@of-networks.co.uk>

We are looking for a very particular type of php developer to join us on 
a very exciting and significant Web 2.0 project.

The requirements of the person we need are as follows:
- A fairly liberal world view
- An interest in global issues
- An interest in ethical business
- Willing to work and become part of a true startup on a non consumer 
based .org project
- A good awareness of current and emerging semantic and Web 2.0 trends
- An open mind, with a creative ability to recognise and identify future 
trends
- Someone that is fed up with working on other people's good ideas and 
not having a share of the pie
- Self motivated  - able to leap tall buildings in a single bound :)
- Good at tackling and solving problems in a creative manner
- At least 6 years commercial experience in the Internet/technology 
sector with a development focus
- Extensive knowledge of LAMP, with specific focus on php development

The roll involves working on the collabarative system design of a Web 
2.0 site and working with at least one other developer on the actual 
code development, documentation, testing and implementation.

The project will be ongoing, however the timeframe for completely Phase 
1 is currently estimated at two months and Phase 2 a further 2 to 3 months.

The project currently only has venture capital from the founders, we are 
not yet looking to dilute equity with venture capital and hope to be 
able to continue in this way.  We would rather trade equity for skills 
and in this way share the future success of the initiative with those 
who created it.

Please note - due our limited capital, financial reimbursement will 
initially be limited to and not more than ?1000 per month, with a view 
to compensate for hours worked at a rate of ?20-25 per hour 
retrospectively (minus the intial monthly or hourly payments) when 
revenue streams come online.  Further to this, a share in the business 
(to be discussed at 2nd interview), hence the lower rate of ?20-25/hour.

This role would suit someone with another means of income, that could 
use their personal time to work on this project.

If you meet the requirements and are interested, please reply with your CV.

I spent a few hours looking around the net for good deals - and ended
up at VistaPrint, king of hidden charges.

They're still good value, though; I'm sure I got 500 full-colour
once-sided cards for about ?25 inc. delivery.

Hat tip: select 2-week delivery, and you will get them within a week.

Peter - even ?170 seems to me a ridiculous amount! for cards... save
the money and treat yourself to a good time :D

Depends which approach you want to take and how important your image is to
prospective clients. Vistaprint are fine if all you need is something quick
and cheap to hand out to people,
but if you want to oooze quality go talk to toby abbott at taylor brothers
http://www.taylorbros.uk.com/ in stokes croft, or seabright
http://www.bni-bristolcompton.com/html/sebright.htm.

Black Cat graphics have come highly recommended for digital print and short
runs too http://www.blackcatgraphics.co.uk/nav.html

I have never been one to hold back on hedonism :D  In this industry you get
given a business card at least once a day and many of them just never make
it to the card holder on my desk...

If you are giving someone a card, then the trick is to have something that
is pleasing to the eye or has a hook that makes a stranger say...
Its worth keeping that one! Thats where the costs come in...

Best regards,

Peter

To satisfy the curiosity of those of us that haven't got one of your =20
cards, what funky stuff does =A3170 get one these days?

I have to say the best 'business card' I ever got was at Submerge =20
last year from Ben Templeton (the flash amsterdam site) as a =20
makeshift one once he had run out.  It consisted of a piece of white =20
flex, cut into a =C55cm strip, with a phone number written on in =20
permanent marker.

Two sided colour on both, they used 400gsm card (most of the other companies
I tried use 200 - 350gsm for more cash) they are laminated on both sides.
Overall the card feels very firm and has an silk finish. They were also
printed off of plates instead of produced on high quality laser printer. I
did find companies that would do it for less but not to the same spec. :)

I like the idea of the flex thats quite quirky :)

ha ha, I have to admit to being a hater when it comes to all that icon
swapping underscore spam, but I just thought the reason I hadn't heard much

Message-ID: <2C49D2C5ABEE8949BE1DBD378A48F0CBCBE899@bbcxue805.national.core.bbc.co.uk>

Hello,

Has anyone had any experience of using satellite broadband for home use? I'm looking at ways to sort my mum out as she lives in a small village in the depths of Pembrokeshire. She has a DACS line share on the line which means she cannot have broadband and she only gets 28Kbps on dial-up! We've been told on a number of occasions that all the physical lines into the village have been used up.

I've come across Silvermead and AVC, both can offer 256Kbps for an OK price (?20 a month) (+ installation of some kit), but I've heard the bandwidth can drop of a lot at times. It would probably still be better than 28Kbps though.

My BiL used to have satellite broadband in the depths of Devon. it worked
fine for him but he wasn't able to get a reliable VPN connection over it due
to the latency.

As far as you Mum having a DACS box on her line, in some cases you can get
BT to swap it onto someone else's line which may make DSL possible on her
line then.

Other thing to consider doing is writing to her AM, the Welsh Assembly have
commited to getting everyone in Wales broadband access.

Message-ID: <C0FCEBD2.26DEA%oliver@watershed.co.uk>


Morning all,

We've got a Polaroid Sprintscan 4000 that we don't use any more. It's really
good and fast at scanning 35mm slides/negatives. The only problems are:

1. It's SCSI (we've probably got a cable somewhere that'll fit whatever scsi
adaptor you have - the problem is, getting a scsi adaptor)
2. You have to wiggle the front a bit for it to work properly. It's a knack
you'll pick up in no time :)

It's pretty unsaleable on eBay, etc, but if anyone on here wants to make us
an offer(*) it's be great to see it go to a home where it's used.

Cheers,

Oliver.

Subject: [_] 3gp video over HTTP
Message-ID: <051f01c6ba20$c362f500$6a66de89@budvar>

Afternoon all,

I'm trying to deliver video to a mobile phone over HTTP.  The phone connects to a web page.  The web page contains a link to a .3gp video file.  The user clicks the link to watch the video (progressive download ideally)... however, what actually happens is that most clients (mobile phone web browsers) seem to think "ah ha, a .3gp file - it's obviously just a big web page - I'll download it".  They try.  They fail, presenting an error message "Page too large".

Now I've tried to force the content-type (to almost everything under the sun) both from the link and from the web server configuration (Apache but hosted, so no direct access to httpd.conf), but no success.

This (messy) test page has been used to find the best solution for PDAs & Mobiles, but the finalists are at the top:
http://www.interactory.com/test/video.html

At the moment I'm suspecting that it may only be possible over WML.

Has anyone done anything similar over HTTP or WML?

Cheers, Alex

What about setting Content-Disposition to force download and Content- 
Transfer-Encoding so it knows its a binary download (i.e. not a

My last response was a bit confusing, even to myself.

What you will want to do is paste the following into the directory  
where the 3gp files reside:

<Files *.3gp>
Header add Content-Transfer-Encoding "binary"
Header add Content-Disposition "attachment"
</Files>

This will only work if apache is handling the content negotiation  
(which it probably will be if its just serving up files from the  
filesystem).

Argghh

"Paste it into a '.htaccess' file in the directory where the 3gp  
files reside"

Although I would assume you had gathered that!

Must be this damnable holiday mentality im lumbered with for the next  
week.

I've been happy with filezilla on windows, as it has easy SFTP support 
(when used with pagaent).

http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/
cyberduck seems to be the best free option on OSX.

Can you use something like Wgetto confirm that the correct content type is
being set on the server? This will no doubt screw things up.

If not, as you dont have access to the server conf, have you tried streaming
the content from a script that is able to set the content type? Most
languages support this. I have succesfully distributed 3gp over http using a
servlet by manually setting the content type to whatever it should be (cant
recall now) and then pushing the binary data down the output stream.

Cheers,

Thank you for your diligence!  I've tried setting those parameters, but not 
from a local .htaccess so I'll give that a go.

Hmmm, yes that's interesting.  The site's done in PHP/Drupal so I can 
envisage pushing it out through a stream.  I'm guessing your solution was in 
JSP - is there any chance you could post up a snippet so I can transcode 
your exact content-type settings?

Subject: [_] Freelance opportunity: Forum implementation
Message-ID: <C0FDFDD3.2F4EE%nic.rodgers@enableinteractive.co.uk>

I'm looking for a developer with experience in selecting, installing and
customising forum software to work on a project over the next couple of
days. Language/platform isn't that important, more important is your ability
to select something appropriate and deliver on time.

Bulk of the work will be editing the HTML templates (most likely stripping
all the crud out) to match our wireframes and integrating the forum's
login/registration with the site's existing login/authentication system. CSS
styling and layout experience not essential but is desirable. Markup is king
- can easily get someone else to style it.

If that sounds up your street, drop me a line and I'll send some more
details.

Remote work is possible, although ideally you'd be able to work from our
offices in Temple Quay.

Nic 
Ps. No agencies.

"OD2 recently lost Coca Cola, which shut down its MyCoke music
service, apparently in favour of a deal with Apple. OD2 has also lost
music retailers HMV and Virgin during the past two years."

You've got to wonder what other choices they had with MS bringing out their
own player and potentially their own music service.

>From a technology perspective they're providing a white box solution based
on technology that's accessible to anyone who wants to license it from MS,
there's a few other people doing this too e.g. Surge who MTV (US) went with.

They needed to be out there with their own brand I think.

I didn't think it was possible for anyone other than Apple to offer a
download service for iPods as they won't license the DRM - weren't Virgin
complaining this a while back and I'm sure there's an anti-competitive case
to be made somewhere..

OD2 are cross-platform, it's just the other platforms are mobiles rather
than Apples, I'm sure they also pre-date iTunes store too.

Ultimately, I guess it's the mp3 players that make online music stores
successful i.e. iTunes is successful because most mp3 players out there are
iPods of one form or another.

Microsoft will indeed be introducing a Zune service -- or that's the early
word, at least. Interestingly enough, the service will *not* be compatible
with their PlaysForSure DRM. 

So PlaysForSure doesn't.

No idea - I get all my downloaded music from http://www.emusic.com. Cheap
(15p/track) and DRM-free MP3, it can go onto my phone(*) or my iPod.

They also have a vast amount of the Naxos catalogue on there if you're into
that sort of thing. Which I am.

Oliver.

(*) Read: brick. But it has an SD slot, which is handy for music/video laden
cards.

Oh well,

More the merrier :o) Thanks for the icons!

So it seems that there is a limit on how many you distribute, useful
info. I always thought that the idea of a 'swap meet' for content
quite interesting. A nice way of generating traffic and interest in a
product/item. I'm suprised its not more common (Maybe it is but I just
didnt notice).

And what made the iPod successful?

There are really three main components to Apple's success. Eliminate any one
of them, and the whole thing begins to wobble:

1. Stylish hardware
2. Software that JFW
3. Simple purchasing (one price, one not-*too*-intrusive level fo DRM)

Their slick marketing hasn't hurt, either, but it wouldn't have made much
difference if one of the above was missing.

And for the record, I do not and have never owned an iPod. Nor have I
purchased anything from the iTunes store -- and I don't intend to. I have,
however, mucked about with friends' iPods of all flavours, and have watched
them buy through the iTunes store (over my better advice, I might add), so I
have some basis for the above other than just hearsay.

So does the N80 that I've recently got my hands on... it also has a

Hmm

DRM is one technology that consumers aren't clamouring for more of,
that's for sure.

Do consumers even understand the impact of DRM?

Only time people will come across the DRM issues is when they want to play
DRM'd content on different devices e.g. an iPod and a SqueezeBox.

Many of them are happy buying crappy quality recordings from online sites.
(OK, AAC, MP3 etc may not be too bad, but I'd say it's not as good as a CD
encoded to FLAC)

Well, going by **AA normal operating procedure like they did in the  
Betamax case, it goes something like this:

1.  Ignore new technology.  (The "Ostrich" principle)

2.  When that doesn't work, sue everyone in sight, including babies.

3.  When that doesn't work, accuse anyone of ever listening to music  
without paying for it of being a thief, even if it happens to be  
elevator musak.

4.  When that doesn't work, threaten tech companies until all the  
players are either out of business, or owned by the big labels.

5.  When that doesn't work, lobby the US Congress, and try to outlaw  
all technology.

6.  When that doesn't work, play the "pity game" and try to convince  
everyone the recording industry is a poor charity, and not the big  
cash-sucking leech it actually is.

7.  When that doesn't work, try to convince consumers that DRM is  
Good and promotes choice, artistic expression and world peace.   
(think: the 70's Coke "I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing" advert)

8.  When that doesn't work, whinge for all eternity, or until the  
next technology comes out.

I think we're at about (7) now, so expect huge publicity campaigns  
convincing consumers that cheap music is bad for *everyone*, and DRM  
is good.

If I remember correctly, there's a possibility the AllOfMP3 loophole  
in Russia might be closed next month, so fill up now while you've got  
the chance, or at the very least, don't leave a load of credit on the  
account.

I lost about $100 of redeemed voucher credit on the US Apple Store  
when I used my Barclaycard to pay for my .Mac renewal and Apple  
realised I was in the UK.  Now I just have a stack of $10 vouchers  
instead :)

Bling, innit.

This will tank - when faced with the choice of this thing or a PSP, it's a
no-brainer guessing which the majority will go for.  Sony are getting really
desperate now.

i'm inclined to agree - the functionality suggests a very useful business
tool, except it looks like a childs toy with those bizarre coloured bits, so
no serious-faced besuited cafe-warrior is going to want to be seen with one.
And the "kids" would prefer a PSP

Interesting, anyone know how close to what you see rendered on screen in
Safari it is?

The question I guess is could this be a useful substitute in a hurry for
testing on a Mac? I'm guessing probably not so speaking as a Firefox
afficionado I wonder what the use of it is... unless you collect
browsers! ;-)

Cheers :-D

problem with any other browser!

Doesn't fill me with confidence I have to admit!

Think I'll definitely stick with testing on a Mac :-D

I should expect it'd do for q&d, and could conceivably be 90%+ accurate for
JS testing.

Thing is, if you only have one test Mac (as we do) and have to get up, walk
over to it, refresh, return to your desk, make amends, repeat, then this
could save a lot of time, even if it wasn't quite 100% you could get most of
your bugs squashed without leaving your desk, then just check the last
little bit on a 'real' browser.

That last little bit could also (probably) be done with browsercam, as any
errors would most likely be down to different font rendering/form widgets in
Safari.

Of course, this won't help at all for older versions of Safari.

it might be useful for testing javascript for safari when you don't have
access to a Mac, but from doing things like running versions of IE under
wine on linux one of the things I have noticed is that rendering never looks
/exactly/ the same as it would on the real thing, so I only use it for
ballpark testing, then make sure I check on the real thing. I haven't tried
webkit yet BTW

It's an alpha. That sort of thing is to be expected.

For the time being, absolutely. 

But if the project stays active, it may become viable.

Well, they do say it's an alpha release, version 0.1pre, so it's not  
really fair to judge it based on that. They only created the  
repository three weeks ago, and made their first release last week!

I think it's a great idea. I just hope they realise that a good  
browser is more than a rendering engine. Not that I should really  
care, as the only Windows I use is BrowserCam.

The chances are that the home brew crew will put together a free tool 
with less bugs and better functionality ...
Besides if it runs on wifi, what network are you going to use? Unless 
you are buying the ripoff BT open zone or something like it,
then Sony must be encouraging little Kevin to go war driving so he can 
chat to his mates that are probably standing next to him at the time. 
After all we have computers at home for IM....


Nice going Sony

I agree. It's not perfect, and not a substitute for proper Mac testing,
put it certainly has a place in my workflow as of now.

I like the way it renders fonts properly, like you were on a Mac, like.

Time to learn it and get it running, TBH.

Besides, I bring my personal computer (PowerBook) in from home so it doesn't
bother me. And if you don't have the Mac to start with, then Swift (the
Windows WebKit-based browser) + BrowserCam might just cover the bases.

FWIW, it installed fine for me though it's *seriously* rough -- form widgets
are dodgy, icons in the toolbar are nasty, scrollwheel on my mouse doesn't
work, etc.

It's definitely an alpha, but like Rick says it's pretty cool that they've
got *anything* this soon.

Ditching the crumby IM idea, Sony could have instead spent their money on
creating a free VoIP network service for the PSP.

apparantly, but I've not actually tried it yet.

A 3rd party keyboard was set for release not so long ago.  But it
mysteriously vanished right before it was due to go into mass production;
people have been theorising that Sony somehow managed to stamp on it.

It would be nice to see someone bring out a case with a built-in keyboard
for the PSP, which could open like a laptop for ths sort of thing (email,
web, etc.).

Fair point, I'll keep an eye on the page and see if their next rrelease
fares any better - getting your software to install is a kinda basic
thing though unless my experience is oddly and totally unique!

Hopefully and added feature of the next release will be the ability to
install the software then ;-)

It's definitely a good idea and hopefully they'll improve the execution
of that good idea :-)

I refer the right honourable gentleman to the sig I gave some moments ago.

I'm also impressed by Star Internet's claim to have scanned the email "for

Most of the people that want that sort of thing have a Treo or a 
blackberry device. I have a PSP and it mostly sits on my desk at home. 
Why go to the trouble of building an add-on that makes a bulky device 
bigger when you can get something thats smaller than a fag packet that 
does the same sort of thing? I got an SPV M5000 when they were first 
released. It was a great toy, I loved the keyboard and if I had an 
exchange server sitting some where to push my mail I would be chuffed. 
But even that was a bit too big to wander round with all day. I now have 
a Treo 650 and although its not as good as the SPV its smaller and 
lighter and the battery will last several days. The mail client is also 
much more well behaved than the Mickysoft one that would occasionally 
dump all my mail into /dev/null :( All I want now is 3g and I'm happy...

personally i'm interested in something that is much smaller and lighter than
a laptop, but has wifi, decent resolution (at least 800px width, so you can
use the majority of websites with no reformatting), full dom supporting
browser and a qwerty keyboard. The nokia 770 is the only device that fits
the resolution requirements, but you need to use an external keyboard. some
of the smartphones with qwerty thumb keyboards come close, but resolution
still too small to make "normal" web browsing viable.

That's just me though - i'm a geek and I like gadgets :-)

Not that it matters but I think SWIM was later? Certainly when I worked
on the site with Beth was a couple of years after that.

So we have to wait until the fireworks night after next for a party,
boo.

It only stores what's changed, so there's no redundant data at all.

I was briefly concerned about disk space, but it appears it just backs up
data to an external drive so that's not too bad. As long as you have an
external drive :)

I'm actually quite surprised no-one on [_] mentioned the Monday PM  
keynote or any of its content until now :)

Quite fun... of course, this kind of capability has been in things  
like Solaris and FreeBSD for a while in the form of filesystem  
snapshots, and in other filesystems too.  However, the fact that it  
actually has a usable UI is pretty much unique.  It's also the best  
sign yet that Leopard has ZFS support, which is a big deal.

However, the biggest new features in Leopard aren't the kind of  
things that make it into a Stevenote... even a developer's conference  
Stevenote.

The two biggest new features as far as I'm concerned are Garbage  
Collection in Objective-C 2.0, and DTrace support from Solaris  
("Xray").  These two will improve the whole OS X user experience a  
great deal by making it far easier and quicker to write better, more  
reliable code.  Overall, that will increase reliability and  
performance.  You can't easily put an icon on that, but it makes a  
huge difference.  Xcode 3.0 as a whole looks very nice too.

It looks like there are going to be some *major* changes revealed  
before Leopard's released, such as a new UI look (if it's going to  
have to be redone to be resolution-independent, they'll probably  
update the look at the same time), and a new Finder, probably based  
around Spotlight.

IIRC, the mailing list was already up and running by the time the event
took place. Nick handed over the mailing list from The Hub meetings to
Robin and that formed the initial [_] list membership. Anyone got a mail
archive from back then? Did Sift archive the list perhaps?

Not that it matters ;)

Well, it's not really a backup program as such, although it's used  
(and advertised) that way.  I also assume it'll manage free space in  
such a way that it doesn't interfere with saving new files.

If your friend is a Windows user, then point out the almighty amount  
of crap that Windows manages to keep lying around in its filesystem.   
For a start, IIRC every .DOC file (and most of the other Office  
formats) is actually a mini-filesystem in its own regard, with a  
chunk of unused "free space" inside it, which is why if you binary- 
dump your CV, it probably contains a half-digested email from your  
mother or some horse porn. :)


I do have concerns about Time Machine, though.  Firstly, the case of  
when you really, _really_ want to delete something... we haven't seen  
that scenario demonstrated yet.  Also, if it's used for more than  
documents (eg. for preference files, or even as a System Restore  
mechanism), then there are a few more niggles I can think of.  I'm  
withholding judgement until I have a good play with it.

The idea is a good one, though.  I've been trying to persuade  
colleagues to use version control for storing documents for years.   
Subversion and things like mod_dav_svn and TortoiseSVN make this  
practical for power users, but Time Machine and whatever Microsoft  
have planned with Vista may bring (simplistic) VC to the masses.

I have a sneaking suspicion that Time Machine will require a reformat  
to work properly, though.  Just like an upgraded Panther->Tiger use  
launchd and Spotlight in a limited "legacy" mode, I have a feeling  
Time Machine will need an erase-and-install to get all the benefits.   
I can see a couple of mechanisms by which HFS+ could be extended to  
support versioning, but I bet they make it a major fundamental change  
instead.


In other news, look at the enhancements to Dashboard (eg. WebClip,  
and the facility to have widgets on the desktop).  Looks a bit like  
IE4's Active Desktop facility, c.1997.  Apple have managed to  
reinvent a failed Microsoft idea and make it sound good! :)

yes indeed.  It won't be replacing my nightly backup, although I might
well run it for some stuff.

but most people don't *do* a nightly backup, so anything is an improvement.

It doesn't backup to the same drive. This means that free space and those
other issues aren't a problem. Otherwise the Finder Menu would have to read:

* Empty Trash
* No, *really* Empty Trash
* Gimme back my space, dammit!
* Arrghhhhh!

Actually, strike that, due to a brainfart on my part.  It is a backup  
program (and more).  They've integrated backup capability (incl.  
scheduled backups to an external drive), and what looks like  
automatic filesystem snapshotting, under the same umbrella.  Didn't  
realise that from the keynote.

They've been tying some nice stuff into the kernel since Panther:   
Tiger added automatic indexing on write (Spotlight), automatic Finder  
refresh on write, and automatic defragment on open (or was that in  
Panther?), so they might be adding Time Machine support that way,  
rather than widespread filesystem snapshotting.  I'm just speculating  
here.. haven't found any developer's documentation on it yet.

Also, it looks like they've got system files going into it too, but  
they haven't demonstrated that bit.  Since the OS X preference system  
("defaults", the wrapper around the huge collection of plist files)  
is relatively fine and clearly structured (as opposed to a monolithic  
binary registry database), they could probably build quite a nice  
"partial restore" function, like the restoration of a single app and  
the preferences for it.

Hmm.. if that really is the case (and it can't backup to the same  
filesystem), then I'm not going to be too happy :)

Newer filesystems (UFS2, ZFS, the thing NetApp uses, etc.) have the  
capability to remember filesystem changes, allowing you to create and  
then mount snapshots.  I was assuming Time Machine used this  
capability, and it was a side-effect of the rumoured porting of ZFS.   
If they haven't managed this feature (which isn't really too hard to  
add, as far as I know), then I'll be quite disappointed.

Admittedly, you can (IIRC) resize an HFS+ partition while in use, but  
I want to be able to run Time Machine on my iBook without (a) having  
an external drive all the time, and (b) having to partition a chunk  
of my HD as a "backup drive".

I'm hoping they just haven't mentioned the single drive capability  
yet, or haven't got it working yet :)

"The first time you attach an external drive to a Mac running Mac OS X
Leopard, Time Machine asks if you?d like to back up to that drive. Set up
the drive and Time Machine takes care of everything else, automatically, in
the background, so you can get on with your digital life."

 - http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html

Which kinda makes sense - you then have a complete backup if your main drive
dies. If people think they're backing up their data, but it turns out the
backup has died with the main drive, they're not going to be very happy.

I wonder if it does "temporary" backups on the main drive if your external
one isn't connected. So you can take the laptop out and about, then get Time
Machine to sync all the file states once you're back at your desk with the
external drive. Probably not :(

Actually, one thing that concerns me is whether it can store binary diffs.
Entourage's "Database" file can easily reach into the gigs, and I wouldn't
want Leopard to copy a 2GB file to an external drive every time I send or
receive an email...

Hi all,

I'd like to tap the collective buyer wisdom concering suggestions of where I
might buy a replacement hard disk for my laptop.  2.5", 80GB, decent cache,
~15ms spin-up/seek, 5,400 RPM, Ultra-ATA 100 - can anyone recommend

I trawled eBay (briefly) last night but didn't spot any bargains... just

Ok ok, its all getting a bit technical for me. Here is the question...
I have an external HDD, i 'tried' to backup my laptop onto it using
some software or other, which has never ever worked, and so I dont
have a backup. I think the first 'copy' worked but... the one where it
is supposed to update what changed never did.

Will this do it for me? Or no? Would be nice if it did as that was my
whole point for buying the bloody external HDD.

You probably shouldn't wait 9 months for Leopard to come out before you do
your next backup!

I the meantime Superduper is pretty easy to use and the free version will do
your backups (the paid version does fancy stuff like automated backups).

Hi All,
 
I have inherited a PHP system and I need to make a change to it, as a long
term perl user I have gotton used to the string handling functions and what
I need to do is easy in perl but can't find a nice clean way in PHP, can
anybody give any pointers. (I could suck it into an array and count it etc
but that sucks!)
 
All a need to do is pad out $data to 8 Characters with zero's e.g.. 012345
to 01234500 but if it is over 8 leave it alone e.g. 01234567 to 01234567.
 
I would normally pick up a PHP book , but i'm in a bit of a hurry with this
one.
 
Cheers
Ross

hehe I wasnt going to wait 9 months, but its been what, hmmm, 2 years
since the original one and me trying to do more but just giving up!!!
It was some software that came with the drive (Lacie) Silverkeeper I
believe it is called.

I might give that one a try then.

IE str_pad( $data, 8, '0' );

You can also change where it puts it, left hand or right hand pad.

Thanks for the suggestions so far - Span looks the bizniz so far.

Question: my laptop's a couple of years old now but, as it's ATA-100, would
it still be able to handle a whizzier 7,200 RPM replacement HDD?

I use silverkeeper for backing up my powerbook to an external drive and it
does the trick - you can set it to backup your home folder and after the
initial backup will then compare files and only backup stuff that has
changed.

Its not just limited to mickysoft though. I went to a Sun conference in 
London a while back, and they had one of the directors turn up to make 
the we're great speech. He stood in front of 700 geeks and  pointed the 
remote at his laptop pressed it and nothing happened. he tried it 
several times then made an angry snide remark about paying the tech 
staff too much money. He finished the presentation and stormed off stage 
to be followed by a geek who picked up the remote pointed it at the 
projector and switch slides calmly. Then he turned to the side of the 
stage where the CEO had gone and said. "obviously we are not the only 
ones that are over paid"  LMAO very funny but I bet he works in 
McDonald's now :)

Yeah.. I'm just wondering if it'll _also_ let you use one drive for  
versioning capabilities, as opposed to backup.  There's absolutely no  
technical reason why not, as snapshotting filesystems demonstrate.

Sure, but the whole demo seemed oriented more towards versioning than  
disaster-recovery backups.  That's why I was a bit confused.  It's  
also a bit weird on the web page, as it talks about "day-by-day"  
restore, and backing up at a given time.  If Time Machine's a  
continuous file-by-file mechanism, then I'm not sure how this  
scheduled backup thing fits in.

I'm going to have to re-watch the keynote a lot closer to try to  
understand this one.

Replacement of Backup.app and its thoroughly unnecessary .Mac  
requirement for writing to CD/DVD is well overdue (especially since I  
cancelled my .Mac subscription last month), so I'm not unhappy to see  
Time Machine.  I was just expecting it to be a snapshotting tool  
using copy-on-write, rather than an external backup-to-drive.  It's  
not clear if it'll allow one-shot backing up to removable media, though.

With the release of Time Machine, and the obsolescence of Backup.app,  
there's even *less* reason to keep a .Mac subscription.  Since  
Flickr, GMail and all the other free or near-free services started  
up, the only real unique selling point now as far as I can tell  
is .Mac sync.  I'm hoping they open that one up soon too, as a  
centralised local syncing mechanism for companies and teams would be  
handy.

The new Calendar server (written in Python, btw) looks interesting,  
and the collaboration tools ("Apple Teams" and the new iCal) look  
like they're going to be quite nice.  If only they were around when I  
had Mac-using colleagues :)

If not, then it throws the whole versioning thing out the window.

Mmm.. the switch from Panther -> Tiger Mail.app changed the database  
format from big binary files to lots of little files, mainly to make  
Spotlight easier, so it's a bit of a moot point as far as Apple's  
concerned:  I suppose they think you shouldn't be using Entourage  
anyway :)

I'm kinda glad:  Mail.app is great, but it's never been a proper PIM  
until now.  Entourage was a great design, but a bad implementation  
(as per usual for Microsoft).

I was ---> <--- that far from writing a decent .Mac syncable version  
of Stickies, so I'm now glad I didn't :)

As far as binary diffs are concerned, I bet it just stores multiple  
versions, rather than diffing, so I think you'll want to put an  
exception on the Entourage file!

take a note of the errors and post them up here - I think I was getting
errors intially when trying to back up to a network share, but it works fine
for the external drive.

hi laura,
i had trouble with silverkeeper too. esoteric errors popping up.

most of my errors were because i was trying to use it to backup from a LAN
fileserver to an external firewire drive hanging off the mac. silverkeeper
does not claim to be able to do this; it only does backups from the mac to a
directly connected external drive. LAN stuff causes problems.

it also has trouble with file access privileges, which could well be your
problem. multiuser stuff can mess things up (confused read/write
privileges). 
try running an osx privileges repair util then try it again (this is
suggested by lacie) e.g. http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/8235

i now use rsync, which has a horrid GUI, but works better for me.

chris

One way that this might operate: snapshot and full dump of that to begin 
with.

To update the copy, take a second snapshot and apply the (blockwise) 
diffs to the backup copy, then ditch the first snapshot. Keep a pair of 
rolling snapshots like this, which'll work as long as the backup copy 
corresponds to the most recent snap.

This would work relatively well for a large (2GB+) files too, assuming 
that they're not being completely rewritten between copies.

Depending on the cooperation between the filesystem and the snapshot 
facility, it'd be possible to still exclude individual files from the 
process.

The whole shebang would be more-or-less independent of the use of 
COW snapshots (or other per-open file versioning stuff, which might just 
work in userland).

er - I back up to an external firewire drive on a Linux server,

Hi Collective Knowledge,

I have been tasked with finding a time control program that can be
linked with Microsoft Project and can be used as a reporting tool along
with analysis.  The application / system would need to have a web based
interface for timesheet entry as well as to be able to provide overall
reporting for departmental heads.

Has anyone had any exposure to such systems and are able to provide a
recommendation?

Cheers in advance.

98% of mine was working, but even after repairing permissions i was still
getting some problems across the LAN. if you're not getting errors you're
hopefully ok.

officially silverkeeper doesn't support LAN backups. i didn't keep my
support email from them, but they said it only does direct local
drive-to-drive backups, so i switched to rsync.

Not tried it myself, but the details are here:

http://www.tnpi.biz/computing/mac/tips/idisk/idisk-v2.shtml

Basically it involves setuping mod_dav on Apache and then tricking the 
DNS and a few other bits to think that your server is the .mac server.

Silverkeeper - just say NO!

- it ate one of our drives once, albeit a long time ago (it was a 3Gb  
SCSI, you get the picture). A whole one, not even any crumbs left.
- then a newer version burnt us again by installing something that  
made it impossible to login in OS X, which could only be fixed by  
deleting offending SW using FW target disk mode.

Retrospect is the only game in town right now.  It's hideous, but it  
works.

Some of iLife can be emulated with Apache (and specifically mod_dav  
and others), as Matt said.  In particular, you can fool Backup.app  
quite easily if I remember correctly.

However, the *useful* stuff (eg. .Mac Sync) is harder if not  
impossible to fool, as the backend stuff is quite complex and  
unpublished.  I spent about a day trying to pick it apart, and  
finally admitted defeat.

One of the apps (can't remember which) is locked down well enough  
(ie. yes, they verify the certificate) that it's not really possible  
to trick.

Anyway, if you just want Backup.app, then it's easy.  If you want  
more, then getting a *partial* solution is possible but fiddly, and  
getting a full solution is not possible.

I finally decided that the only thing I want out of .Mac is the  
syncing, and that's not worth ?70 to me anyway when I can sync most  
of the stuff I need to my mobile and iPod without it.

Incidentally, if this kind of thing happens again, try starting up  
the Mac holding down SHIFT for "Safe mode": it will temporarily  
disable Startup Items and non-essential kernel modules.  Probably a  
little easier than having to find a Firewire cable :)

Ugh.. I'm sorry!   I tried Retrospect and must say it's not the kind  
of software I'd trust backups to, at least on the Mac.

I had a play with the open-source solution, Bacula, which allegedly  
works well with OS X, albeit without a GUI.  It might be overkill, as  
it allows all sorts of weird topologies for backing up over networks  
to different storage nodes, etc.  Has anyone got experience with Bacula?

	http://www.bacula.org/

I must admit that my backup system is fairly basic and inconsistent:   
I copy files I think I might want.  Unfortunately, I have a rather  
bad track record and have lost huge amounts of useful stuff as a  
result, eg. all code I wrote from 1998 to 2000, thanks to the NDIF  
file format.  Grr.

Retrospect needs constant TLC to check the client is up and running  
on every machine in the studio.  It crashes half way through a  
nightly backup about twice a week.  The client macs crawl along while  
backing up.  And the interface is ugly.  But every time we've lost/ 
misplaced/deleted a file we've found it in the retrospect backups.

Horses for courses: we're automatically backing up 15 mac clients to  
about 2TB of rotating storage (12 FW disks feeding it).  Retrospect  
is the default choice for that, what can I say, there are limited  
options available...

BRU has also been recommended to me. <http://www.tolisgroup.com/>   
Haven't tried it, looked complex, got the impression it can't run  
automated backups without making friends with Crontab.

Guys/Girls
A client our ours is looking for a project in which they can display  
financial information such as profit and loss etc nice and sexy on  
the web for their clients to log in to this site and easily see this  
type of information graphically. We were talking about using charting  
software that perhaps reads data from Excel and displays it online in  
a flash component or similar but open to suggestions.
Due to our studio being a tad busy at the moment I just wondered if  
anyone who had some time might like to take this project on.
If so please give me a call 01225 874500 and I can fill you in,  
however I would be looking for people who have experience of doing  
this kind of thing and building the client login web site to access  
these charts.
The client is lovely BTW.

Buzz me if you're interested and good luck.

Cheers
Glynn

I found that on machines with lots of files (e.g. web dev boxes), Retrospect
took half a day to run. No good. So I've ended up with a system where a
central Mac server rsyncs to each desktop as and when it can (using various
funky rsync features like hard linking to save space), intelligently doing
incremental or full backups as necessary. I even found a small CLI app
that'd send a wake-on-lan packet to each machine before attempting to rsync.

Due to the large amount of room needed, the backups themselves are stored in
a sparse disk image (one per machine) on a raid array on a central Unix
server which the rsync server mounts over NFS. The disk image format makes
it especially easy to restore stuff.

Backups fly along - although not *too* fast: rsync can be told to restrict
bandwidth, so it doesn't slow up the rest of the network.

I still use Retrospect on the servers though, it's pretty good once you work
out how to subvert some of its more rigid ways.

Oliver.

Morning [_]er's,
Keeping it simple, I use Zend Development Enviroment for PHP work and
whilst I love various aspects of it (like recognising variables etc)
it runs like a dog on my work machine, probably due to it being Java

Are there any nice lightweight editors out there with code

Thanks :)

Yup. It's pretty good, but I'd draw a loose analogy with cyrus imapd. 
That is to say, if you are running it in a large and complex 
environment, then it'll also work for a single machine and personal 
backups (no backup task too small). But if you're starting from scratch 
and don't have the experience, there are probably simpler tools out 
there.

Tom,
   Yeah we are just setting it up here now.  Quite complex to setup and 
get going initially, and the documentation a bit inconsistent.  That 
said it does seem very good.  Ask me again in a couple of months :)  We 
are using it to backup to a big 36 slot LTO library and it handles all 
the barcode scanning etc.  We are just waiting for our 100Mbit laser to 
be installed so we can start the backups in earnest.

It is sometimes a bit frustrating as it is very good at not letting you 
do stupid things to it lol and when testing it I was trying to move a 
tape from one pool to another and it just wouldn't let me without 
manually wiping the tape first.  Guess that is a good thing.

Oh and be careful as they change the protocol a bit between the versions 
as well.  We installed from ports on the FreeBSD system and from 
packages on a Ubuntu one and couldn't work out why they wouldn't talk to 
each other properly.... found out that we had different versions.

Hi Ben,

Currently we are looking at 60 staff.  This has risen from 40 since I
started here in Feb this year, so there will be the inevitable growth so
I would say 80 - 100 would be sufficient.  I must stress that it needs
to integrate with MS Project as that it the project management tool of

Thanks again for your help. Clive.

I forwarded this to Mike offlist earlier, but sending it here as well, as
everyone else is, in case any one else is interested so I can avoid the
tedium of e-bay:

I have a 12" Powerbook G4 for sale at the moment, was planning to e-bay it
next week.

1.33ghz
512MB RAM
60GB HD
DVD re-writer (+/-)

18 months old, good condition.  It has a new hard disc in it, which is
virtually silent.  It can still get about 4 hours of battery with light
usage.

Comes with all normal adaptors, and I still have the packaging etc, plus
original software,

No dead pixels, either!

Make me an offer if you're interested!

It also has WiFi and Bluetooth.

Cheers,

J

Got it. We lease out a system as part of one of our resource solutions, that
sounds similar and fully integrates with MS Project. I have a colleague who

suggestions. I will come back to you once I get a reply.

Got it. We lease out a system as part of one of our resource solutions,
that sounds similar and fully integrates with MS Project. I have a
colleague who knows about this kind of thing and have just emailed him
asking for suggestions. I will come back to you once I get a reply.

I used to use the Zend IDE religiously, mostly because it was the most 
advanced in terms of PHP use, method tracking, svn, etc. But I recently 
upgraded a REALLY old version of the Nusphere PHP IDE and I doubt I'll 
need to load the Zend IDE up ever again. It has all the features of 
Zend, and then some - the built-in FTP/FTPS/SSH/Telnet support is a 
dream, you can be modifying some code, change tabs to a console window 
directly SSHd into your server, do something, tab back, etc. Upload 
files via FTP on save (via as many staging servers as you like), full 
documentation support, MySQL, SQLite, etc editing built-in - and it's 
FAST, unlike Zend it doesn't rely on Java - the interface is slick and 
quick.

The only issue you may have with it is the cost. I wouldn't have bought 
it outright if I didn't have a cheap ($75) upgrade path to me, as I 
invested in it back in 2000 and it was a bug fest, almost unusable - but 
I am glad I tried it again. Having all the tools you need in one place 
is superb, and the IDE is fully programmable meaning you can script your 
own custom menu actions, etc.

Another (cheaper) alternative might be to try Eclipse, which is very 
well suited to PHP work these days but quite frankly I think still 
massive overkill (180MB download for the IDE alone! Frightening really) 
Still at least it is free, and it runs quite fast too.

Cheers,

Rich

Not anymore -- just a JPEG for Cancun now. Server was starting to groan a
bit, so we eased it's load some. :-)

Nevertheless, I probably shouldn't slag IIS anymore: it (and the Sitecore
CMS upon which the site is built) have handled the crush admirably.

Hey - that's not a bad idea - or I could have one of them (flat screen)

Talking about MSProject, has anyone found a suitable replacement? I've
looked at a few of the demos of online offerings but not used them in
anger. Online and colaborative PM software, if done right, would make
life so much easier. There is also a PM package that handles all the
Prince2 documents and logs - again, if done right it would be really
something. But all the demos of online PM stuff I've tried so far
don't fill me with confidence, and most people still roll their own
solution using wikis, ftp, Excel and our old friend MS Project. There
must be a better way.

ah yes - what we call the Guy Goma effect here, after Guy Kewney's

Untested and off the top of my head..

document.getElementById('theImage').onmouseover = new Function ()  
{ document.getElementById('thelink').style.backgroundColor = 'red' }

and the reverse for onmouseout

It was 10x or so earlier today, based on processor useage.

That's probably not a great indication of traffic, though, as I expect most
of the visitors are hitting 'refresh' on the arrivals/departures boards
which is going to be somewhat more intensive than just wandering around the
static stuff.

Why would you want it to look exactly the same as on screen? That's the
beauty of print styles, the ability to remove extraneous stuff, like menus,
bannerad images etc., which are pretty useless on a printed page. Print
styles also allow you to add information like "This page was extracted from
the Blah Blah site at http://www.blahblah.com", and if warranted to actually
show the urls for links instead of just some underlined text which is also
useless on the printed page.

Chris,

I have an old piece of code which should do what you want!

Put this in the head:

<script language="JavaScript">
<!--

// rollover assumes image is 70x46 pixels, alter accordingly

	button1 = new Array()
	button1[0]= new Image(70,46)
	button1[0].src = "button-off.gif"
	button1[1] = new Image(70,46)
	button1[1].src = "button-on.gif"
	
	function button1SwapOut() {		
		document.button1.src = button1[1].src; return true;	
	}
	
	function button1SwapBack() {		
		document.button1.src = button1[0].src; return true;	
	}
-->
</script>

And this in the body:

<!-- Image code -->
<a onmouseover="button1SwapOut();
document.getElementById('button1link').style.textDecoration='underline';
document.getElementById('button1link').style.color='#148A38';"
onmouseout="button1SwapBack();
document.getElementById('button1link').style.textDecoration='none';
document.getElementById('button1link').style.color='#000000';"
href="#" alt="">
<!-- Image code -->

<!-- Text code -->
<a id="button1link"
onmouseover="button1SwapOut();
this.style.textDecoration='underline';
this.style.color='#148A38';"
onmouseout="button1SwapBack();
this.style.textDecoration='none';
this.style.color='#000000';"
class="buttontext" href="#">Link text</a>
<!-- Text code -->


It could probably be done much more elegantly, for instance if I were
going to use it now I would probably update it to use CSS rather than
styling it within the javascript. Its a start though.

Cheers,

Mark

Yeah, bloody great.  We just called my mother in San Diego, who was  
about to go to the airport to fly on Continental Airlines back to  
BRS, with a six-pack of Mountain Dew and a few bottles of Listerine  
in her carry-on.

Unfortunately, she's got no room in her checked luggage, and none of  
the US websites have the slightest spec of information when it comes  
to the US->UK restrictions.  She's also a bit scared about the whole  
situation to say the least.

Depends on if you believe the propaganda^W^W^W comparisons during the  
WWDC keynote about apple being cheaper than dell.  Seriously though,  
dell do seem to manage good prices for their low end desktops, never

Hi [_],
I have a client who needs to set up a series of phone numbers (0845,0800 
& locals etc) to help differentiate between marketing campaigns.

Anyone now a good/cheap place who do this. Numbers need to forward on to 
a single number and have some sort of statement facility to help track 
number/campaign effectiveness.

Also nice to have message taking/virtual secretary.

Any ideas?

My work machine is a ceap OptiPlex. Ugly as sin. Crap, cheapo case (the
headphone jack promptly broke loose from the plastic anchor, for example). 

Works OK, except this particular mobo has capacitors with a nasty habit of
rupturing after about 2 years. Replaced on-site under warranty, so I guess I
can't moan too much.

Apart from the mobo issue, it's been a PC -- dull as nails, but (also like
nails) gets the job done.

I wholeheartedly agree with the statements made at the WWDC keynote  
for pro equipment - its evident just by comparing the prices.

I recently purchased a computer for my uncle from dell - it was their  
1100 series, which I dont see listed on the site anymore :(
?270 inc VAT - ?60 of which was "delivery".

Came with:
2.8GHz celeron
512MB RAM
15" LCD
80GB HD
Keyboard, Mouse, etc
LICENSED WinXP Home + other misc crap

it's very rare that I want a design to print the same as it looks on
screen.  In fact, I don't think I ever have done.

on the same subject i've just been debating with a client the merits of a
print stylesheet linked up the usual way
 vs having a printer friendly page, i.e as a swapped stylesheet so a user
can get an idea of what they are about to print without doing a print
preview.

Ill rise to this challenge.

Simply copy the text below into the head of your document:
<style type="text/css" media="print"></style>

:)

Seriously though, if you are using a container-div, set the width to  
100%.

Why would you want it to look exactly the same as on screen? That's the
beauty of print styles, the ability to remove extraneous stuff, like menus,
bannerad images etc., which are pretty useless on a printed page. Print
styles also allow you to add information like "This page was extracted from
the Blah Blah site at http://www.blahblah.com", and if warranted to actually
show the urls for links instead of just some underlined text which is also
useless on the printed page.

Subject: [_] for sale: Decklink Extreme card
Message-ID: <81ED06D1-D9D4-4776-876E-234C27611E61@rubberductions.com>

loving home sought for a Decklink Extreme card, this PCI card comes  
with a forest of connections on the end of a thick black cable and  
lets you connect DigiBeta and other video decks over flawless SDI or  
analogue, with audio and serial deck control ports.  Complete input- 
output solution that also accelerates rendering of some Final Cut  
effects & playback, additionally connects a broadcast monitor for  
preview and as an extra workspace.

PC or Mac, but PCI not PCIe so won't work in newest G5s (or Mac Pro -  
hence reason for selling).  Quality bit of kit.  Light use, one  
careful owner etc.  Current retail price ?495 + VAT, accepting  
sensible offers.

drop me a line if interested,

cheers,

andy

Hi [_],
a plumber friend wants to be able to handle credit cards without having 
to have a POS terminal.

I've heard of a couple of schemes where you ring up a number and then 
they authorise over the phone for a fee (e.g. 
http://www.mobilepos.co.uk/costs.html).

Anyone used anything like this/know of a good/cheap one?

many thanks mark, matt, ade

that's certainly got me there. much quicker than googling around.


for the records, i set up a function:

function switchLink(n,w) {document.getElementById(n).style.fontWeight = w;}

then on the image mouseover i simply call:

switchLink('linkID','bold');

where the text link is referenced with an ID:

<a id="linkID" href="#">blah</a>

etc.

Er, SNAP?

Umm, in the interests of sanity, could you please be consistent with
your capitalisation - could one of you be "Joel (not joel)" and the
other "joel (not Joel)" or something? I think there's been a precedent
set with multiple rick/Ricks and PeteF/petefs if you want to fight it
out ;)

It's pretty f*cking extreme let me tell you.  It's petform agnostic:  
will swear at cats, dogs, lapin, etc.

We've just started using it this week, mainly just for to-do lists.  One 
thing I've noticed is just how damn slow it is.  I think it is something 
to do with SSL on Firefox on the Mac.  As it really does go slow 
compared to colleague on windows desktop.  Other SSL sites seem to be 
perfectly fine though.  Anyone else seen this?

having spoke to my bro yesterday, it seems that he might be able to 
hold out a few weeks and save up a bit more cash to buy a new macbook 
which seems more appropriate for his needs (plus the added bonus of 
full warranty, etc).

sorry to those hoping to sell to upgrade.

Interesting problem.  It might be possible to get it working with  
FSCommand, but we couldn't crack it, so we pass it in as root  
variable using query tags in the object/embed - Javascript would be  
your friend here.

Absolutely no good if what you are trying to do is prevent people  
leaching your .swf without your html pages...

It's the opposite problem, actually. This is the flash panorama  
viewer which I showed an early version of to the list a few weeks  
ago. It downloads xml and images from its own domain, but needs to  
work when the swf is embedded in any page on any domain. I thought  
relative links would work, but they appear to be relative to the HTML  
not the swf.  I could hardcode the URL to the xml file into the swf,  
but that would require recompiling for each domain that hosts the  
swf, so I'd rather just tell it to grab it from whichever domain the  
swf is hosted on.

in that case _url should do the trick. I use it often to spot if a swf
is running locally or from a server i.e. the URL begins "file" or
"http" and do debug stuff appropriately.

I think _root._url should give you the answer.

Morning all,

Right I am stuck on this and hope you can help.


What I want to do is the following. I want a multidimensional array to
store a set of triplets of variables. The problem is these triplets
are created by callnig a function, so I don't know how to do this
given the scope arrays have.
This is the pseudo code of what I had in mind:


---start of script

Initialise Multidimensional Array

for loop start{

     Call to function which returns an array with 3 values in it. I
need to store this triplet as
     an entry in the Multidimensional array.

end for loop}

By now the Multidimensional Array should be filled, so now I just want
to know how I can retrieve the various arrays within it, and the
values within those.

---end of script.




Any help with this as I am very new to arrays would be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks,

D.

Message-ID: <e0a1b7230608110313p78e64b8fp651071d11eb76f7f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Ive created PDF documents in the past using PHP, but modifying them
seems to be an entirely different kettle of fish.

We want to prefill a PDF form with the downloaders information, which
we have on file, but there doesnt seem to be any preferred method of
doing this - PDFlib doesnt officially support modifying existing
documents according to Zend.

The alternative is to put placeholders in the PDF itself, and then
str_replace those (or an equivilent with offsets and loops)
placeholders with padded strings, and I think this is the method which
I will have to go with.  This seems very dangerous as you are
modifying a 'compiled' pdf, so Im wary at the moment.

Before I do this, does anyone have any suggestions on better/cleaner methods?

Cheers
Richard

Ben

thanks for that...problem is the basics are fine, its managing to fill
a Multidimensional array from within a function, which seems to be the
problem...

I mean, lets say my Multidim. Array is $products

so,

$products = new array();

for ($i=0; $i < $num_results; $i++) {

   $products.= checkrooms(var1, var2, var3);

}

In the code above, the function checkrooms returns an array with 3
elements in it, which I would like added to the Multidim. array
$products...

Does that make sense? Can anyone help with this, as I am getting
errors "Fatal error: Cannot use string offset as an array in" when I
try doing this, so something I know is wrong.

Regards,

D

This might be a bit of a long one so bear with it.

The following is a basic example that I've used to populate an array
with a set of results from a poll.
I've used an associative array here just because I find them easier to debug

function get_poll($poll_id=NULL){

    if (isset($this->poll_id)){
       
               
        //SQL SELECT METHOD CALLS
      
       $result = //assume some code here to query a database and return
a result set
                   
        while($row = mysql_fetch_object($result)){
            
            //set a counter to the next array value
            $cur = count($this->poll_answers);

             //check that their is a valid id for the given poll
            if($row->ans_id){
                //add value to array
                $this->poll_answers[$cur]['ans_id'] = $row->ans_id;
                //add next value to array that is a child of the
previous one.
                $this->poll_answers[$cur]['ans_id']['answer'] =
$row->answer_id;
            }
       
        }
    }
//return the function value as an array
return $this->poll_answers;
}

Then you can grab the contents of your array using something like this

//call the function that you want to generate your arrray
//this example uses a class but it can be any function call
$poll_answers = $poll->get_poll();

//only show array content if it is has values
if(count($poll_answers) > 0){
   
    //iterate through the array
    for($i = 0; $i < count($poll_answers); $i++)
    {
            $p_poll_ans_id = $poll_answers[$i]['ans_id'];
            $p_poll_answer = $poll_answers[$i]['ans_id']['answer'];
     }
}

On a completely different note, if you want to simplify the way you
develop I would certainly look into the Object Oriented approach for
PHP. It will cetianly cut down on your headaches.

Try this instead:

$products = new array();

for ($i=0; $i < $num_results; $i++) {

   $products[]= checkrooms(var1, var2, var3);

}

Note the difference on line 5 ($products[] = instead of $products.=).

PDFlib does support it as the "PDFlib+PDI" package. Create your template as
a PDF. Then have PDFlib create a blank PDF placing your template PDF in as
the background, then place whatever you want on top.

That's if it's cost of 900 EUR (per CPU) is acceptable.

Very good library it is though, well recommended.

(If the cost of PDFlib+PDI is too much then just draw the thing from scratch
using standard PDFlib?)

Urgh.  The management has heart attacks about costs much lower than
that.  May be fun putting in the request tho.

And here in lies the main problem - the form is a set layout for a
government agency.  We cannot change the layout, even slightly (I
guess they do automated scanning on it) so drawing it from scratch
would probably involve far too much time getting the layout perfect
against the real thing.

Thanks for the answer, it does indicate that solutions exist.

Hello. In case you're still having problems, these may help

- in order for a SWF to access content from another domain, the target 
domain needs to have a crossdomain.xml in its web root.

All relative links are relative to the html, not the .swf (although they 
may be in the same directory).  It's part of the sandbox restrictions.

_root._url works but _level0._url or this._url (on the root of _level0) 
are better form.  "_root" is evil and wrong, especially moving to AS3 as 
"_root" doesn't exist anymore..

Yeah you need the PPS version for that (PDFlib Personalisation Server), 
which is uber-expensive if this is a 'smaller' project. I think someone 
already quoted you the price.

Well if you can afford the PPS route you can build the PDF template with 
Acrobat, marking up the dynamic regions with the block tool. Then use 
PDFlib to insert the data into the blocks. Far less messy and dangerous 
than the usual 'line writing / pixel placing' technique, but as 
mentioned, very expensive.

Alternatively build the form entirely using the free version of PDFlib, 
or the very good (although slower) FPDF, which I've used a number of 
times and love the simplicity of.

Or look at Reportlab (http://www.reportlab.com/) their commercial stuff 
is not cheap, but is used a lot in financial services for thinks like 
account opening packs etc, where customer details are overlayed on a 
template pdf.  Their core lib is open source, so you can build on top of 
that is you have the time/skills to do so.

You could simply define the array as being global:

global $array

As the first part of your function. Then you can access it just like you 
would any other local var, modify it, etc.

You need to do it as Ben showed ($products[] = function()), or make the 
function modify the array globally as above. The above will force the 
result of checkrooms() into a string, for appending to $products, which 
will give a Fatal error. Doing it the $products[] way will create arrays 
within your array (one per call to checkrooms).

If unsure, you should dump out the array at have a look:

print_r($products);

wrap it in <pre> tags if doing this in-line with your HTML to retain the 
formatting. Or use a true PHP debugger, but the above will work just as 
well for this.

I vouch for PDFlib+PDI, having used it extensively in my last big  
project.  It works by allowing you to load an existing PDF and place  
it like an image into a new PDF.

They also have another product (PPS) that allows you to define  
placeholder blocks and then fill them in.  This sounds more like what  
you want.

There are other ways of overlaying information on existing PDFs,  
although you'll probably spend a chunk of time getting it right.  I  
ended up writing Perl scripts to alter the PDF directly (yick)

Check the small print... you're required to buy a PDFlib licence for  
commercial use anyway, including use of PDFlib Lite (ie. the open  
source version)

A small question to aid me in my hobbying...

Did anyone do some basic electronics at school/uni?

I've got a 25W, 240V AC halogen bulb (G9 fitting, although that's not
important apart from the fact it's impossible to get a basic holder for it
that's not part of a fancy light) that I'm using as part of a model I'm
building, and the fact that it's 240V AC suggested to me I could just wire
it straight up to the mains. However, when I did so, it shone for about a
second before blowing.

It's been suggested that I need to put a resistor in series with it, to
limit the power flow to 25W? If that's right, how big a resistor do I need?
Or did I just get a duff bulb?

Thanks _ brain,

Oliver.

you want to step down your voltage to 12V and then run your bulb off 
that.

(think of the equivalent lamp you'd buy in ikea with a massive white 
power supply slab attached to it)

Watts = amps x volts
Amps = volts / resistance

The volts obviously stay the same and the current is dependant on the
resistance of the circuit. If the bulb is designed for 240V, then it should
have the correct resistance to limit the power output to 25W. Therefore, you
got a dodgy bulb, I reckons. ;-)

i remember douglas adams raising a point many years ago - with so many
electrical items stepping down to 12V, why isn't there a push for an
integrated 12V household circuit to accompany the main ring?
we could do away with all the  transformer blocks, i can count at least 15
under my 2 desks. i'm convinced it would save energy - they're all hot.

What's more, almost none of them do 24amp or 30amp, they all need fusing
down to 2, 5 or 12... another waste.

I think Ben is the one who is right here. If you have a 25W 240V bulb
it should run straight of the mains.

make sure its not 230V or something silly like that though. You could
try sticking a resistor in series as this would reduce the power a bit
(and the voltage). You'll have to do the maths to get the resistance
of the bulb and plan the resistor to be about a tenth of it or
something to drop a little power. I'm guessing the bulb's resistance
is about 2300 ohms so, you could always get a nice (mains suitable)
variable resistor and stick that in series with it and see what helps.

Failing all that perhaps you do not have a 240V bulb...? Or your mains
supply is very dodgy.

I'm not sure how much difference it would make within a home, but the  
lower the voltage, the more is lost through the resistance of the  
wiring. This is why the national grid runs at such high voltages, and  
there need to be substations all over the place just to step it down  
to 240.

It's not a GU10 bulb, or other one that runs off 12V DC. It really is a 240V
bulb, like these ones:
http://www.eurobatteries.com/sitepages/halogencapsule230v.asp

And Stu - I thought our mains supply *was* 230V these days? The continent
upped from 220 to 230, we dropped from 240 to 230, to harmonise.

Ben: that was my supposition. But then, electronic circuits always seems to
do the exact opposite of what you expect them to.

I'll try my remaining bulb of the two-pack, but this time I won't touch the
glass, and will solder connections properly (rather than just wrapping
wires) to see what happens...

Thanks for all your suggestions.

Oliver.

12v lines... yes

hello, my names adam, i've been lurking for a while...

can't find the link but i read one recently

 a house in the states normally consumes 45Kw/h per
day

by putting in 12v as well as 110, they reduced this to
800w/h

most stuff ran on 12v, stereo. lcd tv etc. even a 12v
washing machine

as far as i can see most modern electronic stuff only
needs this much... using transformers chucks away a
load of energy (turns it into heat)

i've been pondering writing to the council &
suggesting they rip out all the power supplies in
their pc's and have some big 12v loop in the
building... maybe not exactly that but power over
ethernet looks good

in the meantime it also looks sensible to use as much
bus powered (usb etc.) stuff as poss rather than
transformers (that said i'm still using a serial
modem, i have got a little usb one somewhere, maybe
i'll break it out again)
 
i have some doubts that 12v would be enough for all
situations... but it certainly looks to me like
anything 12v is ideal for powering by wind/solar etc.
leaving big stuff (cookers/hoovers/my ludicrous 7.5kw
shower) to the mains...

That would be fine if they didn't need screens ;-)

12v gets eaten up by cable resistance over a long distance ( such as
round an office)
and so you would get far less reliabilty under load.

If the compuers , wiring and building where designed with this in mind it might
be possible to make it work but i would have thought the consultancy and bespoke
kit costs alone would dwarf the money saving for at least 10 years or so.

Tis a nice idea though .

The spec for PoE is 48V, for the P = R*I^2 reason (that is, power lost is
proportional to current squared - and the higher the voltage, the less
current you need to get the same power).

Presumably, however, one could save energy by building a box with one large
12V transformer in it and lots of sockets. You could then just make up a
load of custom cables, with your equipment's plug at one end, and whatever
socket is on the box at the other, and plug all your equipment in.

You could also just switch off this one box overnight, rather than unplug
loads of little transformers.

Or would this not save any energy at all? I suppose it depends on the
quality of the transformer you use...

Oliver.

There's really not anything you can complain about with
Fasthosts. Good control panels and good uptime. Webfusion,
on the other hand, are slow and clunky and have horrendous

There are a million things I could complain about with fasthosts.

1) Open Rsync access to your data!!!!!!!
2) Ridiculous pay-for backup policy - lose data friday night, backup  
overwritten monday morning.
3) The just lie about their products - look at the dedicated servers  
(http://www.fasthosts.co.uk/dedicatedservers/). Try getting a custom  
server for ?25....
4) Awful customer support

I wouldnt touch then with a 10-foot pole (unless it was REALLY spiky).

Hi All

It's certainly monday morning for Lloydstsb.  I tried to log in this  
morning about 10ish.  On the PC it just won't connect but on the  
MAC,  First of all it wouldnt connect, then the site turned up  
without any formatting.  Now some of it is in place but it's  
definitely not what a bank wants it's customers to see Im sure.

The availability is also a bit iffy.
Probably a DoS caused by everyone calculating the charges they have  
made over the last 6 years :)

They have changed some things with their service, I called their
phonebanking this morning and you now have to input your acc no and
sort code to their automated woman and then you are supposed to tell
the automated system charachters from your password but it didnt
recognise mine, its a pain in the ass then you get through to the
bloody call centre in india!

Woo hoo what fabulous customer service, I ahve had an account with
them for 23 years and I so want to leave!

So Leave.

I moved from LLoyds to Smile 5 years ago (after 20+) years with LLoyds. I have never regretted it. 
There was just no incentive to remain loyal to Lloyds, also Smile are part of the Co-op and have an "ethical" investment policy.

Agreed, same here.  I had been with Lloyds 7 years (until about 2 years ago)
and they were crap.  I moved to Smile too and they are brilliant.  They even
give you a days grace if you go over your agreed overdraft without charging
you the usual *ridiculous* ?25 or whatever it is.  They also have the nicest
online system I've seen.

They sent me little sunflower seeds too this year, just to say Thanks for
Being A Loyal customer.  It was very cute.

Message-ID: <9f8e922b0608140518mde1ef50pc63ce9f3fecffa72@mail.gmail.com>

Big up the [_] massive (or something),

I've been a bedroom DJ for about 15 years now, but haven't ever felt
confident enough to release something to the world... until now.

Would Ableton Live allow me to build up a set like you'd build a tune in
Acid, then dump the finished thing as a single audio file?  It certainly
looks like this is possible, according to the DJ
showcase<http://www.ableton.com/pages/live_6/showcase/for_djs>on the
Abtleton web site, but I may be wrong.

I've tried using Acid for this in past, but found the software too limited
in scope for this particular kind of thing--much hair-ripping when it comes
to start frames and subsequent transitions between tracks.

Thanks in advance, tipsters.

- Pete F.

borrowing (which I am trying to sort out!) and so no other bank will

Sure can,

Why don't you download the trial?
Well worth every penny in my opinion, although i use it more for  
production.

Easy peasy...

Live is fine for DJing if you like DJing the way live works..  I  
still use vinyl and mixers and other such dated nonsense as I find it  
more fun :-)

You will probably have to fix some autowarp glitches but most of the  
set building you can do either by hand by dragging and dropping into  
the arrange timeline or by doing it "live" in the session view and  
recording your actions to the arrange page...

You can also edit these "live" mixes after the fact..  Not that  
there'll be much wrong to edit as it does all the lining up for  
you..  Just hit play on a clip less than a bar before and as long as  
the warp markers are all correct it'll all be technically in time..

It might still sound a bit wonky as tunes tend to have a groove to  
them so things like snares might be early or late or whatever so you  
might have to mess with those warp markers again to get it all  
sounding right.

One thing to watch is the option for how it time stretches the audio  
to get it in time...  For a DJ set you'd want to use "pitch" (old  
school higher pitch as it gets faster type) or "complex" (nu school  
granular cleverness that can sound good or rubbish) depending on what  
you are trying to achieve.

You can make much more interesting mixes as long as you don't go  
overboard on the layering and effects...

Less is more and all that :-)

Good luck...

Stef

Thanks Matt, Stef,

Sounds promising.  I'm not big on the effects side of things, but I've a
little bit of history doing music production at University some years ago,
so being able to do some post-production too would be great.

I'll download the trial tonight and have a play.  Know any good, non-obvious
online resources for learning Ableton?

If you get the chance to glance at the bottom of page 2 of today's
Independent, look out for the special offer. Tracy Emin has written the word
"BEIRUT" in the middle of an A2 piece of paper, photocopied it, and is
selling them off at a tenner a time for Save the Children. I agree with the
cause, but she could have put a bit more bloody effort in. Sorry, some
things annoy me too much not to share...

While you're there, Robert Fisk's analysis saying the real war between
Hezbollah and Israel has only just begun is fascinating.

On a lighter note...

Robert Fisk is terrific - I'm slowly battling through

can't abide Tracy Emin.  Just give StC the money instead.

Message-ID: <29A2FA84-15F6-4A52-8C71-E5210A159C8C@completecontrol.co.uk>

Guys
Are there any animation students that would like to do a week work at  
the Complete Control studio to help source animation sequences for a  
new kids TV show called the Secret Show. The job is to watch tons  
(26!) of episodes of the show and get to know it inside and out. Once  
you've then overdosed on kids TV you will then use a database system  
to search and find images, animation sequences that we will be using  
in our games.
Sound like fun ?
If so drop me an email with your details on and finish this line off ...
'I think Complete Control should pay me to watch cartoons because ...'

ps this is a runner role ideally for an animation student to get a  
weeks experience of working as part of the crew on a leading  
production. Start date tomorrow, money ?200.

Please forward to anyone you think might like to do this.

cheers
GLynn

been done and a license has been purchased.  All in all its turned a

Perfect.

Message-ID: <542f5d890608141209x6593608ck17a971c89ef009b7@mail.gmail.com>

I came across a rare thing yesterday - in fact it is the first
Windows-only website I've had the misfortune to use for many years.
BA, Easyjet, Flybe, Ryanair, French/Dutch/Swiss/German railways,
National Express have all been platform agnostic for as long as I can
remember.

For the pleasure of paying 50% more than flying, I decided to make my
next trip abroad by environmentally-less-bad train. First attempt
(Safari) failed. Second attempt (Firefox - price now ?10 more -
presumably in the ten mins since the first attempt the last "bargain
super cheap" fare had gone) and this time I get to type in my card
details and click the "buy" button... at which point an "Ooops!"
screen pops up. No indication that the transaction has or has not
worked.

Of course, being outside office hour, the phone number did not work
and, of course, I've not had any response for any of the three email
addresses I complained to.

So beware!

F.

PS -  In the small print I managed to find that the site works find
with Windows Internet Explorer 5 (version 5.00.3314.2101 upwards) and
Windows Netscape 6.01 upwards

PPS - Slogan of the RailEurope website: "The experience you've been looking for"

It does use GAIM, but I'm not sure which version -- might be a different one
than is in GAIM 2.0.

Thanks, tho. It does help to know that at least some versions of GAIM aren't
affected.

Anybody know of a code editor for linux which will do an FTP sync each time
I save a document? I'm looking for something that works as smoothly as the
one built into dreamweaver. I know I could probably get an older version of
dreamweaver working under wine but, looking for something native if
possible.

I had that with travelsupermarket.com last night. There I was,  
responding
to a TV ad, and it threw me out *after* I'd done a search.

emacs + ange-ftp or tramp.  I use it all the time, but have never used
dreamweaver so I don't know if it's as smooth as that :-)

I signed up with NTL 3for30 offer for our new house in Reading and I
can't find any info on what kit they supply. I'm trying to figure out

No idea what set-top box either at the mo. Anyone signed up to them recently?

accompanying image of the front page to make the download page look pretty.

sadly, clients being clients, they nearly always try to upload a PDF instead
of the image (and then tell us it doesn't work).

any ideas for something that runs on Linux, and allows us to extract page 1
of a PDF and convert it to a JPG or PNG or whatever?  We tried ImageMagick
here, but on a 50 page PDF (and some of the files are bigger than that), it
just swallows too much server resources, and we had to kill it before it
managed to do anything.

Cable Modem and nothing else for broadband
You will want to buy either of the routers you mentioned.

Subject: [_] complex web app - mapping and road data - any takers?
Message-ID: <C1075A5D.510AD%chris@tallhat.com>

hello,
i've had an enquiry for a web application which needs take postcode inputs
and work out travel times (UK roads) between them, and compare to actual
distance. it then needs to work out a costing for the journey after deciding
whether to use the shortest or fastest route.

e.g. from the spec
"The Application must be able to calculate the shortest and fastest routes.
The quote provided will be the fastest route (hence distance), except where
this distance exceeds the shortest route by xx%. This percentage must be
able to be edited by The Operator."

that last bit seems a bit garbled, but i think i know what they mean.

has anyone done this, or know who best to use for development/mapping data?

cheers,
chris

It might also be worth buying the same make of router as you
have wireless cards. It can make a big difference to the sort
of performance you'll get.

Just my $0.02 or less.

GS? Something like:

gs -sDEVICE=jpeg -dJPEGQ=75 -sOutputFile=my.jpg -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE my.pdf

It'll take a little bit of resources too, but I find it quicker than
ImageMagick. (The fastest I've found are the built-in OS X PDF handling
routines.)

I'm got the 614 connected to the cable modem that Telewest gave me  
and it seems to work fine throughout the house,  I even get OK signal  
in the back attic bedroom despite the router being hidden under an  
armchair in my front room and the laptop in question being a Powerbook.

Deals with the two laptops connected at the same time fine as well..   
Had no issues so far with it TBH...

Mine arrived with everything open and available though so don't  
forget to turn on the password protected bits and bobz to stop others  
nicking your bandwidth...

Unless you are a sharing type :-)

I use them and they're probably as cheap as you'll get. Never had a

I'm doing something with mapping, not directions though.  No idea  
what they mean there.  As to data services, postcode anywhere are  
good, 8p per credit (less in bulk).  Each API call uses x credits,  
for example geocode postcode and house number to a lat/lon pair costs  
1 credit.

Full details on their site, or feel free to email me.

i'm assuming that's simply a postcode distance triangulation rather than
something which takes into account topology and roads.

this client is after something with a good accurate and up-to-date national
'road route' database to enable comparison of shortest and fastest routes
between postcodes.

it's bound to be fairly expensive to license this sort of application, but
my main question is has anyone done anything like this, and who would
provide the main data/lookup (e.g. can the googlemap API do this?)

Used Trillian for about a week 2 years ago and quickly got fed up: at the
time, it was adware, a resource hog and a wonderful vector for malware (my
SO's computer was hijacked via a Trillian worm, though I personally never
had a problem).

May well have improved since then, but I'm frankly leaning towards waiting
for the GAIM problem to get fixed as I'd as soon use F/OSS anyway.

> Didn't like the GAIM interface tbh. 

Nor do I particularly, but I had some silly idea that I'd be better able to
shift back & forth from Adium on OS X if I used it than if I used something
Windows-only.

Not sure why I thought that, TBH.

May just go back to Miranda <http://miranda-im.org/>, which is extremely
lightweight, has a better UI than GAIM and can be quite powerful if you get
the plugin situation sorted (though as with FF extensions, it takes a while
to figure out which are worthwhile).

For our route-aware car sharing system (which I won't give a URL for 
because the site desperately needs a redesign and I fear Underscore 
would tear it into tiny pieces) we license road network data from the 
Ordnance Survey. We use their Merdian 2 product (and Code-Point for 
converting postcodes to grid references). But a lot of munging of OS 
data would still need to be done in order to do what you want.

Cheers,
Ian

yup. we trig from the middle of each postcode area to get approximate 
distance.

doesn't cope with one way streets and traffic jams.

Pricey, yes, but it does provide pay per use access for things that  
would otherwise be very pricey.

Very true.

Does anyone know why OS dont provide mapping data as a public service?
Seems very wrong that we pay them to exist, and then we have to pay  
them again to access the data they collect on our behalf?

Anyone with me on this?

Presumably what we pay them to exist doesn't cover all of their costs of
mapping. Thus they have to sell the data to make up the shortfall. Sounds
reasonable to me - one way or another, those who need it will pay for it,
and those that don't won't pay nearly so much.

Oliver.

We use Capscan to do this , they have loads of API's for intergration, we
use the perl one and it works ok. But not sure if it uses roads or grid
ref's.

hello,
i've had an enquiry for a web application which needs take postcode inputs
and work out travel times (UK roads) between them, and compare to actual
distance. it then needs to work out a costing for the journey after deciding
whether to use the shortest or fastest route.

e.g. from the spec
"The Application must be able to calculate the shortest and fastest routes.
The quote provided will be the fastest route (hence distance), except where
this distance exceeds the shortest route by xx%. This percentage must be
able to be edited by The Operator."

that last bit seems a bit garbled, but i think i know what they mean.

has anyone done this, or know who best to use for development/mapping data?

cheers,
chris

Chris -

At the risk of having you turn to the Dark Side, wouldn't the MapPoint
API be useful for this sort of feature ? I'm relatively sure I read in
the docs there's a routing API which is used in some demos for mobile
applications - obviously if it's *not* mobile you've less of a worry
about connectivity to the service.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/mappoint/
http://msdn.microsoft.com/mappoint/mappointweb/default.aspx

I do remember you can apply for a developer key through MSDN, there may
be other routes <sic> not sure of pricing but worth asknig on the
microsoft.public.mappoint.* newsgroups

Hopefully that covers Europe, certainly the similarly monikered Mappoint
(program not web service) provides UK/Europe mapping - the equivalent
standalone prog in the USA is Streets & Trips, but I think both of the
standalones use some form of the Mappoint SDK internally could be wrong,
not unknown)

Cheers - Neil

I know that my Dad worked at National Grid some years back mapping the
locations and routes of the grid right down to local level and they
had to buy the data from OS and you bought it by layer, each layer
being more/less detailed and it cost them hundreds of thousands for
that information.

The fact that the OS survey is expected to charge other bits of the
government for its services is rather silly, though I have less
objection to charging companies for the same.

As someone who goes off walking in remote places every now and again,
I am *extremely* grateful that we have the OS, though...

phpical can subscribe to webcals (i.e. published iCal format calendars that
are posted elsewhere on the web) - you just give phpical a list of URLs to
subscribe to.

I presume, then, that those calendars are fed back down into your own iCal
app, but I've never tried that. Even if it doesn't, I've been hacking
phpicalendar around for my own nefarious purposes, and it's pretty easy to
get to grips with.

I used to do plugin development for trillian pro, enough that an old  
site of mine beats trillian's website on some searches for plugins.   
It was very memory intensive, but the plugins just made that worse,  
there were all sorts of useless things you could get.

As an IM client, it's about equal to Adium imo, Adium is nicer but  
not as featured yet.

Just set up my Dad's new connection - they provide a nice enough cable
modem which has a good Ethernet out and USB connection. Always on,
works nicely enough.

I'm pleasantly surprised, but then again I've got a stonking white
cable connecting the laptop and modem right now. Don't know how
wireless will turn out.

I doubt it's necessarily a good thing to go with what they suggest, but I
found this link a while back for somebody else if you haven't taken a look
already

http://www.ntlworld.com/toolsservices/wireless/?page_zone=211.6.8

I'm running an airport express off the standard cable modem on my telewest
setup, which I assume is the same as what NTL will now supply and it works
no problems at all.

Indeed. And they claimed it was WAI AA-compliant, too. Fools. Dan

I'm sure there's a sweet spot of web site spend. At first, quality
rises in proprtion to the amount spent, until you reach this
enterprise-level precipice. After that, the quality goes through the
floor while the cost keeps on rising.

Honestly, is that all??

72,946 pages of content isnt a small DB project.

Yes, it is a lot of money, but for a .gov tender, that is not bad. Sadly.

I'd reckon 75% of that money goes on "dealing with ignorant, jobsworth,
couldn't get a job in industry pen pushers".

No, wait, I misspelled "project management".

And besides, only a small percentage of those pages were actually
migrated into the new CMS.

It depends on the state of the original content really - if that amount of
content was already in logical format in a database and migrated across to
the new system, there shouldn't be too much difference between a 100 page
site and 100,000 page site.

If each of those pages needed to be tidied up, and manually cut and paste
into a CMS, typed, or tediously extracted by a script from static pages then
manually checked then that's a different matter.

You probably wouldn't get it, unless you are a Very Large Corporation:

"One distinctive feature of HMG's IT policy is its enthusiasm for
mega-contracts, worth hundreds of millions or billions of pounds. As a
result, four fifths of government IT spending goes to 11 contractors,

Also from TFA:

"I am not suggesting offering special treatment for British business.
Like smoking dope in the Cabinet Office, that would generate certain
legal difficulties, as well as being thoroughly antisocial."

It would?? Seems to me they've already been smoking something a lot
stronger if they think that those "hundreds of millions or billions
of pounds" have been well spent so far.

No, and neither are Fujitsu. Besides, it said "nearly all".

Have a read around some of the links I posted to see what some
determined people and the good old Freedom of Information Act can
achieve in terms of finding out just how UK.gov operates (clue: not
very well).

One problem is that the office of the eEnvoy (putting "e" in front of
stuff is so last bubble) makes the rules regarding IT best practice,
but doesn't enforce them. In fact, it's not entirely clear that
*anyone* enforces the rules. Thus, we get IT disaster after IT
disaster as risk-averse civil servants run into the arms of the
largest companies. As we all know, though, most of the best web work
is being done by the smaller shops...

Possibly not. They did the integration work with the CMS (Percussion
Rhythmyx) but, as has been pointed out by comments on Dan's or Bruce's
site, it's possible to have a standards-compliant, accessible site
running on Rhythmyx. Thus it's the fault of the people who built the
templates, which seems to be Fresh01.

Sounds like a "jobs for the boys" type affair. Who'd take odds on
Fresh01 being comprised of relatives or mates of a civil servant at
the DTI?

When faced with Bruce Lawson's questions, The DTI fobbed him off with
the "that'll cost more than the limit for FOIA requests" (?600)
line...

This kind of comes back round to what I wanted to see working for all
the small companies around Bristol, what I had hoped something like
Bristol Media might lead to.

A central point that could co-ordinate a bid for large tenders like
government contracts bringing together a number of smaller
organisations and freelancers to work together on large projects with
a central project management resource, ie someone to put the word out
that the tender was open, co-ordinate the response and then project
manage the various parties involved throughout the project. I think it
could work but involves a kind of different mindset possibly, that
through collaboration bigger things can be acheived.

I would still love to make this happen, I just dont know how!

I've been worried of late that some of my incoming emails might be going

requirements:

- virus scanning and (sigh!) effective spam filtering
- can handle multiple addresses (although, not necessariliy mailboxes).

any ideas?

It doesn't *exactly* fulfill your needs (no IMAP), but you could try  
looking at GMail For Your Domain.  I've been using it for a month  
now, and it's great.  It's also free.  You get Secure POP instead of  
IMAP, and you get 25 mailboxes and a catchall.  You can set up the  
mailboxes with redirects if you like.

	https://www.google.com/hosted/

	http://gidden.net/tom/2006/07/09/gmail-for-your-domain/

They give you something like 6 MXes to add to your domain, and I'd  
say Google have a pretty good reliability record. :)

It might take a few days to get the invite once you've applied, and  
you might not get it at all.  My personal domains were accepted  
quickly, and I don't think they're really vetting the applications  
that much.

Afternoon _'ers,

This is a long shot, but does anyone want to buy a Peugeot Speedfight
2 100cc scooter? It's in immaculate condition and is currently being
serviced, X-reg but only 2.5k kilometres on the clock. I'm moving to
London on Saturday so I need a quick sale, hence ?700 ono.

Replies off-list please.

Cheers,

that's my take on it certainly.


yep probably is the case.

However in /my/ experience sometimes design shops only provide a photoshop
mockup of the template rather than the HTML. This is in fact a good thing
(unless the design is unworkable). I remember having an argument with a
design agency who kept sending me a photoshop generated tabletastic HTML
version of a template, complete with javascript rollovers etc when all I
wanted was the original photoshop file. They thought they were being helpful
and couldn't understand the fuss I was making or why it took me a day or so
to produce the real HTML template from the photoshop file.

Yes, but Bristol Media can't really be held as a shining example until 
it and/or SWScreen pull their finger out and sort out stuff on their own 
doorstep.  The comments on the blogs following the DTI website highlight 
some things that have been bubbling away on my mind quite a bit 
recently.  Namely the issues of accountability and are (public sector) 
clients able to accurately judge if the result meets their requirements.

Take the Bristol Media website as an example.  The tender docs for this 
*clearly* called for the site to be visible to search engines.  This is 
something it completely and utterly missed.  There is no way to get to 
the directory contents of the site, for instance, without a form 
submission.  Now is this a failure of the company implementing it in not 
following the brief, or is this a failure of the tenderer in checking 
that what they asked for was delivered?

On topic of search, why do so many sites still get this wrong?  Again 
the Bristol Media website doesn't search on company names... try typing 
in the names of some large bristol media agencies in the search box and 
you will be surprised at the results... unless they mention their own 
name in the body text they don't show up.

And as for South West Screen..... try searching their website.... oh? 
you can't find the search? No neither can I.  I don't think there is 
one.  So for all the text size change icons and accessibility statements 
all over the place, it is unusable to even the able-bodied.  I'm not 
making these examples up.  I followed a link from a Bristol Media 
bulletin to the SWScreen site about something that was of interest to 
me.  No joy... broken link... no problem just search for it.... oh, no 
search box.  I nearly cried.  Is this really that difficult?

So many of you will have seen already that bristol media are looking for 
a 'sponsor' for their website:

http://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/articles/2006/7/26/website/

This is to re-do the site and fix some of its existing shortcomings. 
Yet has no budget.  So is it most likely to be handed to a small, 
in-experienced startup with no track record to repeat the same mistakes 
again? Or maybe some experienced companies might do some pro-bono work? 
  Or is that free pitch work?  No cost = no value?  Hrmmm... anyone got 
thoughts on this?  Would the people making the decisions on the client 
side understand these issues?  Would they care?  Hey, I mean... its not 
a film or anything, right?

Cynically yours,
-Matt

we tendered for this the first , but our design skills weren't deemed good
enough (which is probably fair, but we did say we'd be working with outside

I am not sure that anyone would disagree! I was just pointing out what
I was 'hoping' for! I am rather dissapointed.  And I would still like
to set something up where the collaboration idea could really work.

it is also worth noting that the ?175,000 was just for the design aspect and did not include the CMS cost, which was a further ?200,000, which was procured separately - just to twist the knife for all us taxpayers. I wish I could find the link to where this was clarified, but it was a few weeks ago now that I saw it.

I don't think it's even that...

I've just finished an 18 month contract with a government agency and the
incompetence of some of their suppliers is unreal but yet they seem to win
work over and over again, and charge outrageous fees for what they do.

One supplier I was dealing with was a two man band that literally couldn't
organise a piss up in a brewery, delivered an app that didn't work properly
with the most awful UI and when we were doing the migration of 10GB+ of data
from one server to another, couldn't understand why we needed a backup and
test plan becuase "there's nothing to go wrong". It beggars belief and
despite the managers in agency knowing how crap they were they stuck with
them on the basis of "it's better the devil you know"

OK then. As seems to be usual, it's "don't attribute to malice what

Afternoon all!

This is probably going to annoy a lot of you as I am sure this has
been discussed over and over again, but there you go.
I am used to integrating payment service provdiers where payment is
taken on a secure page on the providers' hosting, not on my clients.
This time round, they want to be able to allow customers to store
their credit card details, and when the order goes through will be
processed manually through their PDQ machine.
This is how the current website they are using is doing, although it
doesn't allow for storing, and I am wondering what the best way,
php/MySQL wise would be to go about this.
I now an ssl page will be needed, but any help would be very greatful

Regards,

It would be important to check that their merchant account permits  
this. I'm assuming that their account permits internet CNP  
transactions. Aside from it being a really bad idea, a lot of them  
won't allow you to store the numbers. Even if you can, you shouldn't  
keep it on the web server itself: it should be on a different machine  
not directly connected to the internet. It's a minefield I tell you!

First thing I'd do is check that their Merchant account provider will
allow them to do this. I had a client who used carnet and they point
blank refused to let him do this. The last thing you want to do is carry
out the work and then find out that the client is unaware that the
system goes against the T&C's of their Merchant account use.

If anyone's interested - bought 2 desktop PCs today from PC world (couldn't wait for Dell end, plus they would probably burst into

Didn't get monitors - it came to ?370 each.

That's quite a good deals isn't it?

Nice case too, with a snazzy blue light behind the power switch.

2. Save each part to a different sql server running on another machine
that the webserver only has insert rights on.  These servers should
not have a default gateway set and various other security

3. Only allow select rights from inside the LAN.

We tendered for this too, and the feedback we got was basically was that 
the winning tender was chosen as they produced nice visuals and 
storyboards.  Which being a board made up of mainly film/tv people makes 
sense.  Once again it comes down to the comments made in the blogs about 
the DTI site -- do the people commissioning public sector sites know 
what they are doing?

Clearly the tender process for public websites doesn't work, otherwise 
we would not end up in messes like this.  So question is, is there a way 
for us to somehow educate the tenderer?  I've had similar discussions 
with a large (big 4) consulting/accounting firm on how to do the same 
for Open Source.... the tenderers do not understand what they are asking 
and so ask the wrong questions.... hence get the wrong answers back.

So back to specifics then.  Bristol Media want a new website.  They 
don't have any budget.  This is the site that is meant to represent and 
promote our industry sector.  Should we just try to convince them to get 
a budget from their funders (SWScreen)?  I would have assumed that they 
would have tried this already?  But if they can't?  What? Petition 
SWScreen directly to give them budget for this? Try and get Bristol 
Media moved out from under SWScreen?  Build it by public subscription?

You need to store the numbers encrypted. Ideally noone on the admin end
should be able to view any card numbers especially all the numbers
stored in the db (hmmmm soon-to-be-ex-employee thinks Select * from
user_card_details and go on a shopping spree, not good, or worse still,
anonymously stick em all on a mailing list and watch the company go down
the pan).

My advice, don't do it, leave it (and any potential lawsuits) to the
professionals, there are plenty of different packages out their that let
you integrate a third party payment gateway into your luverly branded
site and you don't have to deal with currency conversion, tax issues and
a potential security audit from the credit agencies. If they've not done
it up to now, is there a real business case for doing it now and having
to take the responsibility/flak for the can of worms that will
inevitably follow?

PKE is the only method of encryption that should be used in a  
scenario like this, i.e. the server can encrypt the credit card data,  
but not decrypt it.
Decryption should be performed on a single, secured machine.

It is my understanding that you would not pass risk-assessment in  
order to store user card details anyway, and would therefore be in  
breach of the merchant agreement as outlined by your bank.

The easiest method is to utilize an online payment gateway that  
provides deferred (card shadowing) or preauth/repeat (verification  
and future payment) billing.

If you encrypt the details using an asymmetric crypto such as PGP/GPG 
then you won't need to store the decryption key on the servers.  Encrypt 
the details then stuff them in a database.  Then when you need to get to 
them, copy/paste the encrypted details returned to you into PGP/GPG 
running on the local desktop and feed in the passphrase and it will 
decrypt it.  Type the details into the POS terminal and then when done 
just close PGP.

This way the details are never stored in plaintext on the server, and 
there is not the private key nor passphrase stored on the server.  Only 
compromise would be if someone stole both the desktop PC with the 
private key on it *and* beat the passphrase out of the owner. (Or read 
it off the post-it note stuck to the monitor.... *sigh*)

"meant to represent and promote our industry sector"

does it really though? I see very little evidence of that, is anyone
really getting any support or value from it. We probably all only know
of it because there was a request to tender for the site that went
about when it first started.

Another problem would be that the account details whereby users could
login and update their credit card details would also need to be well
encrypted. After all if CC details are stored then they're going to
expire at some point and the user will need to amend them.

The main loop hole hear would be that each users account, which could be
cracked/hacked whatever.

Unless you're really up on your PHP , MySQL and Server Security when
running a web application like this then I'd agree with rick and suggest
that the client uses a reliable payment service provider i.e. protx,
worldpay, secpay or something along those lines

If you do want to look into securing PHP applications etc then this is
as good a place as any to start

We had a risk assessment form through a number of years ago from a bank 
and it was about 8-10 statments and you had to tick yes/no.  They were 
so vague as to be useless, such as:

* Does the server have a firewall?
* Is the server secure?

Almost as useless as the website tender doc (yup back to them!) on which 
we had to state that we were in agreement that should we hit granite 
when tunneling that we would take responsibility for the incurred delays 
and costs to the project.  It also detailed what specific parts 
constitute a canal lock gate.... thats what you get for using a model 
form contract from the early 1900's, drawn up for the tender of the 
converstion of London street lighting from gas to electric, for a 
website project.

Actually... While it's on the table does anyone have any  
recommendations for payment gateways..

We are looking to finally upgrade our shop to one that uses web tech  
post 1997 and this is one of the things I need to look into..

Ideally one that is multi currency friendly, allows deferred payments  
so we can only charge once we've shipped etc and set up all these  
things within our own admin system which would mean they provide some  
form of API to connect to rather than the old school "file on their  
server in a frame type" stuff.

Global micropayments via text messages would be a bonus as well.

And we don't need (or want!) to store users card numbers.

Cheers for any tips,

Stef

I would use Protx if I were you, if you setup as a reseller you get
commission too!

The integration is simple and effective, if using .Net you only need to pass
a Guid through the querystring making it that much harder to tweak with the
values.

There is one problem as I understand it, with this method in that if the
customers machine with the private key on goes down, i.e. hard disk
failure then none of the encrypted CC detail can be read by anyone ever
again. So I'd certainly suggest making a copy of the customers public
and private Keys to avoid this. Only problem there is that you then have
encrypted data backed up on multiple devices. Que the thief from earlier.

Stef,
Protx i think are great. Easily set up, customised and have pre-auth
for differed payments. No micro billing tho, would be interested to
hear suggestions on that one from others!

Well exactly... and this is my beef... why would a company want to 
sponsor their website development if they didn't know what exactly they 
were sponsoring.

If fairness there has been some forward movement on this:

http://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/events/

7th Sept 6pm is a 're-launch' party at Goldbrick House.  So hopefully 
the board of Bristol Media will tell us what they are planning for the 
future.

Thanks for all your input. Sounds like storing c c details is best
avoided. How about just storing cust name, adress etc, the asking for
card details on ssl and sending to email. That way they can process
and delete, job done!
Thoughts?

you need to upgrade to version 2.6 - that one even develops itself so you
don't even need to pay those pesky developer wages ;-)

if only some bright sparks would write a book on it...


it would be out of date by the time it's finished - you just need to bribe

My point entirely. They seem to have made good inroads with the
film/tv community, and ignored digital media largely. I think that is
a major sympton of the problem of chucking film/tv and digital into
one big pot, they are hugely different industries which operate in
very different ways.

The main 2 things I see are that

a) film/tv is a far more mature industry with well established
networks and practices and people who work in that industry are well
aware that networking is their bread and butter.

b) Essentially, making some gross generalisations but then i am a fan
of them, people who work in digital media are geeks who would rather
sit in front of a computer than go and network with random strangers

Ah that old chestnut...

Your point about educating these bodies is a really good one Matt.

If I recall correctly we thought about bidding and then got told that they
wanted to *own* the IPR on the content management system used (which in
fairness might be the reason why the engine used for the BM website was umm
seriously sub-standard?). Being asked for IPR on software that you've
written and also for free pitchwork on jobs are common naive requests
that are inevitable when you don't actually have anyone knowledgeable and
proactive from our industry on the board.

Being represented by a body that actually understood who they were
representing would definitely improve the chances of them understanding what
they were asking for...

I don't know if anyone else has sensed it but there seems to be a bit of a
battle over the interactive ground as well as the broader creative industry
bucket. Plenty of cash flying around and I for one would be interested to
know what's being spent in our names. I'd also be up for doing something to
ensure that this is wisely spent. Hell if it's being mis-spent give it to
Education or the NHS!

Right... which was my comment on getting film people to spec a website. 
  So what should we do?  If digital media needs to be treated separately 
then what do we do?

1) Form another separate group outside SWScreen?
2) Lobby/Petition BM to be moved out from under SWScreen and deal direct 
with SWRDA? (and then have people who only understand old buildings 
commissioning websites ;) )

I am, personally, opposed to fragmenting groups as I think there is one 
group already and we should be able to get that going.  It is already 
started and just needs a push.

Also as Bristol is in the finals for the Digital Challenge and going to 
be the most e-Aware (yadda yadda) city in the country, then maybe moving 
BM (or its next generation) up a level to be a sibling, rather than 
child of SWScreen is a valid route.

Good point.  But then I think digital likes to network too... the 
skillswap sessions are a good example of this, and will be great when 
they get going again.  But yes, if the digital community likes to exist 
in a virtual world, then maybe the website for that virtual world really 
does become even more important as our shopfront.

Out of interest, do SWScreen produce regional showreels/etc of work in 
the region? Who pays for them SWScreen?  Is that not analogous to what 
the BM website *could* be for the digital sector with some funding?

This is something that you could do using something like PGP or GNUPG to
encrypt the email before sending this to a secure mail account. However
you'd still have the same problem of eventually unencrypted CC details
on the customers computer.

Most merchant accounts do come with online payment gateways, I would
suggest that you use one of these. This way you can completely avoid
handling any credit card details at all.

Taking the IPR is standard on every single public sector contract  
we've won.  AFIK, it's a situation created by lawyers to ensure that  
UK.gov is free from punitive licensing in the future, and has  
appropriate rights to modify, reuse, disassemble, etc.

Because it's obviously nonsense, we have a sensible conversation with  
the client about it every time, and it's always relaxed.  We explain  
how *transferring in entirety* the IPR prevents us from trading as a  
business, as we are left with nothing to sell.  Ever Again.  Ever.

We then suggest a 'shared IP' situation and everyone goes home  
happy.  To happy bunny land.

andy

There has been a massive decline in interactive members appearing at  
the networking events.  Taking the speed networking as an example, I  
think I've been to all but one (or maybe two if there's been another  
recently).  The first few events were full of useful and varied  
contacts, a couple of which I actually did business with and would  
have not met otherwise.  But each time it's happened the split has  
moved in favor of the TV/Film Industry, to the point where last time  
I went it was pretty much 90/10.  Why is that?  Bristol Media's basic  
advertising isn't targeted at a particular industry which leads me to  
believe that there's either more TV/Film people based here or they're  
more willing to network (for either of Laura's reasons).

I feel a bit sorry for Bristol Media, I remember early emails when  
they were trying to set something up were already pulling it down.   
Forcing a community between disparate groups is a hard job, without  
an organic natural community forming (such as Underscore) my belief  
is it takes a shit load of cash to continually draw people into  
situation over and over again until the human nature takes over.

I'm pretty sure this conversation was had early on when the company  
involved in creating the site posted [_] for comments and suggestions  
of the kind of tools the Bristol Media site should have.  I'm then  
pretty sure this consultation continued and included a number of  
meetings with various members across Bristol.  I can't comment on how  
many of these suggestions got created, and to what quality, but that  
seems like a pretty solid beginnings.  Why haven't (interactive)  
people used it?

It would be a very useful exercise to understand the issues and  
failings in the steps taken so far, both for ourselves and to place  
in front of BM. Especially before calling for a revolution.

Errrr.... you are going to encrypt those credit card details in PGP or 
similar before you send them right?

That's not 100% fair on this one - the winning bid was very solid and  
contained a lot of value.  Can't say more unfortunately.  But it was  
a shiny bid.

We are finding the same with local authorities.  They are buying web  
sites and web apps using a procurement process designed for boxed  
software for desktops and terminals.  Sample questions:
- 'how does your product integrate with Active Directory?'
- 'confirm that your application can be deployed on Citrix  
application server'
- 'your application must have no impact on network load'
(these are browser based apps)

but I digress.

<http://www.spark-online.co.uk/> is a subscription thing - have a  
gander.

My 2p: 10p:
- Bristol Media and associated site were shaped by several group  
meetings at Watershed.  It was a remarkably collaborative process for  
a public sector body.  Most of the meetings were open, free (natch)  
and in a reasonably convenient location at a reasonably convenient time.
- Whether it works in practice is obviously a matter of free debate,  
but it was explicitly not imposed from the top down.  Although there  
were politics involved (natch).
- the website brief was above all to create a usable directory  
focussing on making it easy to network, recruit, and find  
employment.  The size of the talent pool is the single biggest issue  
we face, work is as easy to find as it could ever be (my view, feel  
free to throw bricks).  How well does it do this task?
- the wind has gone out of the sails with BM since Claire left, less  
events, less sense of momentum.  Now would be an ideal time to  
address this.
- we examined this before with the short and regular group, which met  
regularly, for a short time...so just a plea to not reinvent wheels?

cheers,

andy

Erm, they would be very happy.

As I understand it - if you do this with a product (e.g. a CMS or a
Consultation system say) then technically you could not resell it
without their permission (nor they without yours). Certainly you could
never offer the shared IPR to anyone else without their consent (and
if you have done this you could be in danger of some major legal
action).

Also if you intend in the future to make a lot of money out of any
product you have given join IPR on you could well end up sharing it.

It really doesn't leave you in any better a situation than you giving
them the IPR, it just leaves them in the same position.

It's a fair point, and I should clarify.  Presumably the CMS would  
make extensive use of pre-existing IP on the developer side?  These  
shouldn't be included in any shared IP situation, that would be  
onerous.  That's your pre-existing IP and is one of your assets.   
It's unrealistic for a client to expect IP on that.

For example we built a consultation system that had a nominal cost of  
?40k to us, but licensed it to a client for ?12k.  We retained that  
IP, but shared specific IP around the skinning, specific  
configuration, reporting, management process etc.

That client specified a complete IP transfer, but were eventually  
convinced by the value argument (and the odd bit of hardball  
negotiation) to share the IP.  They were open about wanting to own  
and resell the software, but as you'd expect, they couldn't really  
advance any kind of compelling argument as to why they should do that  
and cause us to make a loss.

If you work jointly with the client to develop some IP, or even if  
you are retained to solve a problem for them without their help, then  
it's a fair argument that you shouldn't be able to resell that  
without sharing with them, unless you can show some significant  
discounting on the price they pay versus the value of the asset created.

Anyone want to pick holes in this - it's really useful to get fresh  
perspectives.  Personally I think we need more peer discussion about  
business models and tactics, and less flame wars about JS vs. CSS  
image replacement.  Perhaps I'm in the wrong place though?

cheers,

andy

Actually there is very little use business wise in such networking
events for web/interactive. For TV/Film it makes absolute sense, as
they all do business with each other. For us we would be better
spending time networking in a more diverse setting. Unless you are in
the business of making websites for local production/post production
companies there is little business to be had. For meeting with people
in your own industry skillswap is better, but so is having discussions
on underscore.

The thing is, things will be a success if they offer something people
need and want. It needs a business case. Took a bit of work to realise
that for such a thing to be a success in our industry is not easy, and
is certainly hindered when the organisation trying to do it is focused
on a very different industry. But fear not, they have had no problem
securing public funding that is aimed at us, or in spending it.

We are a bloody resourceful and self organising industry - otherwise
we wouldn't be having this conversation right now. I don't see the
need for an organisation to self appoint themselves as representing
our industry. The only thing that annoys me is that there is public
sector funding aimed at promoting and developing our industry. I can
think of a million things to do with that that would really improve
awareness, and facilities for us.

Actually a lot of these things have been provided over the years by
the Watershed, where we had the original [_] meeting. Where they have
provided space for us (as a community) on regular occasions to support
what we as a have chosen to do (for free and out of their own pockets)
- and in initiatives to promote us. They have supported education and
up and coming small businesses, and have worked to relate our industry
to the community around us and promote our local industry in the
national press. They are championing Bristol in the digital challenge!
If anywhere was to be central to us and be a place I would be happy to
see funding for us being spent, it is there.

To have a revolution there needs to be someone to overthrow, I don't
see any leader here. Acquisition of funding does not imply authority.

I retrained to Zope from Perl.  Looking back, that bandwagon was a  
brilliant move.  Don't know how I put up with Perl for webdev?

Yeah, I don't doubt it.  Perl's pretty esoteric at times, and it's a  
lot easier to do a new language right than fix existing bad  
practises.  Also, in my defence, I learnt Perl from a very basic book  
that missed out big topics like CPAN.

As to chocolate covered wafers, if you can suggest a good place to  
get them in Redland at 2315 at night, please do!

The problem is that most small shops would go bust before the tendering 
process had got to best and final offer. Even this pile would have taken 
ages to purchase, let alone build. I spent a year writing a bid for a 
government department. 4 months in workshops doing "requirements 
capture" (in a team of 3 with specialists dropping in an out as we 
needed them) then 2 months writing the bid (15 - 26 people full time) 
then spent  6 months waiting while deadline after deadline slips "We are 
so hopeless at meeting deadlines..." one chap once admitted to me over 
lunch.

The killer is that while all this is going on you are unable to commit  
key resources to other tasks in case the department actually meets its 
commitments and hires you...

The secondly 175K is an amazingly small amount of cash.

When you write any proposal to government 90% of the costs involved are 
based on assumptions made from requirements capture.
Most of that data is completely wrong and then needs re assessing by 
someone that understands the issue instead of the  government bod that  
made a blind statement. Then when you win the bid, the process starts 
from scratch again as what the department actually want will have 
changed. thus My winning bid of ?29,000,000 or there abouts was at 
?350,000,000... mainly down to changes in specification and customer 
slippage....

Government money looks easy cash but its quite a nasty way to earn a 
living :(

Amen. We have done some large EU-funded projects with government  
agencies that shall remain nameless, and it was a nightmare. We were  
the only SME on the project: the rest were universities and govt  
agencies. Because of this, we seemed to be the only partner who cared  
about the fact that we were more than a year late in receiving our  
first payment. In the meantime it was costing us massive amounts in  
terms of out of pocket expenses and man hours. Let's not even get  
into the paperwork that was involved.

Hi

I know some people out there are mostly Mac based - so can you tell me 
how easy it is to set up PHP and Apache on Mac?

I use mac for design and then build sites on windows.

I'm using OSX 10.3.3 - but am thinking about getting a macbook soon.

PHP4 is already set up - nothing to do there, you simply go into  
"system Preferences" -> "Sharing" and turn on "Web Sharing".

A more complete PHP package can be found at http://www.entropy.ch/ 
software/macosx/php/
You simply run the installer, and its done (still need to turn on  
"Web Sharing")

Mind you, if PHP+Apache is all you want (ie not MySQL as well) then
Mac OS X comes with PHP 4 and Apache built in. You need to uncomment
the line in the apache config file that enables mod_php.

MAMP, though, is the way forward if you want php 5.

They're already installed. That said, it's better to use something  
like darwinports or fink, as it allows you to easily add other stuff.  
I do all of my LAMP development on a Macbook, with apache, php5 and  
mysql5 installed via darwinports, and it's fantastic. I used to use  
fink, but found darwinports nicer. Our stuff isn't exactly simple  
either, needing quite a few external libraries and extensions, but it  
all works beautifully. I can use exactly the same setup as we have on  
our Debian deployment server, simply needing to change the root  
directories in our config files.

I am really pleased that this sparked a sensible discussion, as that
was what I hoped would happen. I agree with Dan's points on the speed
networking, and thats why I didnt bother with the last one, I saw
little value in it for me.

I am not suggesting that BM is the be all and end all or that it will
solve any problems or issues, however, as Stuart points out, it IS
using money that is earmarked for interactive/digital (whatever you
want to call it) and people in that industry ARE a target audience.

Regarding Matts point about showreels, I believe that BM wanted to
produce a showreel, but in DVD format, which again lends itself more
toward Film/TV than digital but also that the budget was EXTREMELY
limited, in fact in my humble opinion it would be impossible to
produce something worthwile with the budget they had. Especially as it
was aimed at promoting Bristol on an international platform, I mean it
has to be bloody good if you are going to do that otherwise you just
embarrass yourself.

Regards networking, I thought that perhaps forums of some sort on the
BM site could be of value as 'virtual' networking and that if people
got some kind of intrinsic value from that and enjoyed the discussions
they would be more inclined to attend other 'real life' events.

Basically from my perspective I was really keen to take over from
Claire and had lots of ideas and I 'hope' that you guys know that I am
hugely enthusiastic if a little misguided at times! But more than
willing to take on the views and opinions of the community, however,
the feedback I got was that I was 'too ambitious' and it was 'just a
little part time job' two things which I massively disagree with. I
think its a big job to make BM work effectively and a big task for one
person to take on, and I dont believe there is such a thing a too
ambitious, I am not ambitious for me, but for what could be acheived.
I was a little nervous to write this stuff in a public mailing list,
as I have no idea who is reading it but, its the truth and so there it
is.

TBH those facts have made me a little, whats the word, disillusioned
(?) with BM and made me feel that they dont have a strong idea of what
they want to acheive and are basically happy to tick some boxes for
SWS targets, which annoys me as I still believe there is great
potential for great things.

I would like to find a constructive way to input this groups momentum
into BM and to move things forward in a positive manner. And I think a
bloody cocktail party at GoldBrick House (co-incidentally owned by the
new chair of BM) is a waste of money and could be put to far better
use. It wouldnt be a waste of money if I could see that BM had
acheived something.

As for the pitch and do a free website idea well I (wonder if I should
say this again in a public forum) but I think its a load of shite. We
as an industry are forever bemoaning and trying to get away from doing
free pitch work and to do a free pitch AND free work for an
organisatioin that is spending however much on a bloody cocktail party
IS a load of shite. PRIORITIES!!!!!!!!!! And the intimation that you
will get respect on a national and international level for doing it is
also a load of shite, you sure as hell wont with the way things are
going now.

I'd like to know how many D&AD members have ever heard of Bristol
Media????? Or ad execs you know, the people out there who HAVE the
budgets to commission work from the likes of the people on this list?
I would hazard a guess at VERY FEW IF ANY.

Anyway enough of my ranting, it isnt getting me, you or BM anywhere.

Resigned to it all,

Laura

I agree with Tim... go with MAMP.  If I remember correctly, it works  
on Panther (10.3), but it's probably tested less on that than Tiger.   
You should be fine, though.

I personally build either from source, or occasionally using  
DarwinPorts, but that's just because I want my own configuration  
settings and additional gubbins.  More trouble than it's worth, quite  
possibly.

If you ask me, Apple should consider adding PHP and HTML syntax  
support to Xcode and put a decent AMP stack in the Developer Tools,  
rather than gripping for dear life onto WebObjects and OpenBase.  WO  
is a lovely system, but most definitely on the way out.

Hi
    you will find that PHP and apache works out the box on most linux 
distros to. you could run up a VM machine and install linux to try it 
out first...

Good Luck

a good rant, Laura - and I agree with it all.  We have made a decision that
we do no free pitches any more, nor free work.  Nor free consultancy, which
is what some people expect us to be doing.

speaking for myself, I can't see that BM can offer me anything - we're not
doing "sexy" sites, we're not doing Flash, we're a two man^H^H person
company who don't wish to get any bigger ...

mac - I dont see it as about you needing to get any bigger or do flash
or anything, its about, or rather i would like to see it about, you
getting more of the work that you want to do and getting paid more to
do it. And that goes for anyone and everyone.

I would like to see them sponsoring things like SkillSwap (which is
running out of sponsorship) and expanding and doing SkillSwaps for
other industry segments too, I would love to do one every week on
different areas, one for programmers, one for designers, one for film,
for editors, for producers, cameramen, small business ideas etc etc
etc

I see the whole thing as about creating opportunities for people to do
what they want and upskilling the region AND also very importantly
promoting the region and creating opportunities for those in the
region to promote themselves.

That's sad and unfortunate because part of the original BM debate  
focussed on how to serve a wide spectrum of needs without giving  
special favour to any one sector or size of business.

Promoting (for example) Flash was just never an outcome of the  
discussion, and I find it honestly strange that you would think so;  
it leaves me concerned about how the organisation is perceived.

cheers,

I can't say I've been keeping track of this whole issue over the past  
few years, having only just moved back from London.

However, there have been enough of these industry groups/forums/ 
committees/junkets over the years by the usual suspects, and the only  
one that's survived and thrived is Underscore... a relatively  
unorganised ad-hoc mailing list with no funding (other than the  
wonderful ongoing support given by Netsight) and *very* sporadic  
meetings, set up by someone who's not even on the list anymore.

Anyone trying to bootstrap another one of these initiatives (yicky  
word) really should think about leveraging Underscore (in the nicest  
possible way), rather than trying to score more funding.  It doesn't  
seem like the mantra "If you build it, they will come" holds true.

Anyway, when's the next opportunity for a decent-sized pseudo-[_]  
meetup with beer?  I haven't been to one in about seven years...

Tom

That would be Mike Bennet from E3 then (having just googled GoldBrick
House). I can now understand why Bristol Media is so supporting of the
rest of our industry :) and why the only mention of our industry on
the Bristol Media website is in the last paragraph of the about page
with the line.

"Digital media is booming with around 200 specialised firms and trails
being blazed by the likes of  South Bristol wonder kids E3, fast
becoming European leaders in the digital industry."

So you are a trail blazing European leader E3, or one of many
"specialised firms". Its no wonder SWS think Bristol Media represents
our industry - obviously E3 is our industry.

it wasn't (unusually :) a dig at Flash*, but more a statement of the sort of
work we do, and the sort of people we do it for.

Perception is everything and I personally believe that is the biggest
issue that BM has to deal with in the interactive sector, it is not
meant to be Film/TV centric however, that is how it is perceived and
that is why there is reluctance to get involved. IMHO of course!

bah - I don't want [_] to be leveraged.  Horrid word.

another meet would be good, but preferably not in the Watershed [tips hat to

We had several this year, organised by someone who is on the list, (oh
yeah me!) and the next one is September after SkillSwap as usual!
Monday  September 11th ... 6-8 for SkillSwap 8-close [_] meet up.
SubSub are providing beers for SkillSwap, and there will be sandwiches
and cakes.

I see a recurring problem here, but some background first: our  
business cross all of the sectors, e.g. Film, TV (a bit), animation,  
digital media, and occasional print work.  I also engage personally  
with SWS, the RDA, watershed, the universities, and anyone else I can  
get in front of.

The problem is that in trying to engage with the digital media  
community, which I believe is a key emerging sector in the City, very  
few people can articulate coherently:
(i) what the structural problems are for the sector in the region (or  
specifically in Bristol)
(ii) what they would like done about it

But SkillSwap seems to offer genuine value and be well supported.   
This is something we could push if we can show it will
(i) meet a demonstrable need
(ii) be effective and deliver value
(iii) be supported by the industry and not wither on the vine

thoughts, alternative suggestions?

Absolutely I agree 100% and that is why it has been supported thus
far, however there were political and personal reasons why that
support kept being threatened to be withdrawn. And personally I think
it is far better suited to SWS/BM support than its current sponsor.

yep,  after our flurry of "meetings that aren't underscore" the other..
err.. year,  I think we ended up with a list of things that people that
people did and didn't like, but no clear vision of where to go from there
other than to meet up regulalry to discuss things, which petered out pretty
quickly, I think mainly because people were too busy and had too many
commitments to meet up that frequently.

But SkillSwap seems to offer genuine value and be well supported.

yes, skillswap is one thing that has genuine value in our sector and has a
proven model in the original Brighton version, and this is something I would
like to see supported by Bristol Media/SWS.

Yes, I unreservedly apologise for using that word.  I don't know  
what's got into me.  I even used the words "synergy" _and_ "paradigm"  
non-ironically in an email the other day.

What I really mean in this context is "keep in touch", I guess.  For  
example, Laura seems to have done a great job in keeping [_] informed  
and involved in SkillSwap without being the slightest bit annoying  
about it, to the extent that I'm disappointed I haven't been able to  
attend any of them, and I'm usually one of the more cynical and  
apathetic ones.

The Bristol new media do's I've gone to in the past have usually  
started with a well-funded cocktail evening introducing the opaque  
and self-appointed committee usually led by one large ego, and have  
fizzled out into thin content-free newsletters getting more and more  
sporadic over time until they just... stop.

While I appreciate the herculean effort required to keep such a thing  
going (as I have myself tried and failed miserably), they just don't  
seem to work.

Whereas, as far as I'm concerned, drinking beer while collectively  
hurling abuse at scared product reps (eg. the IE4 presentation given  
by that Microsoft evangelist at the Watershed back in 1997) will  
never get old.

I would tend to agree... I find that it all gets a bit too fragmented  
at the Watershed when held in the main bar.

There's a world of difference between PHP and WebObjects. Maybe they  
could replace Cocoa with Javascript or Carbon with Perl? The WO  
frameworks have far more in common with existing MacOS X development  
technologies than PHP. Even Rails is a closer match to the way most  
Macintosh developers think but it is still very different to  
WebObjects.  I guess that is why Rails will be in Leopard and Apple  
haven't hidden their enthusiasm for Rails. Apple definitely do not  
grip onto WebObjects for dear life. More a love-hate relationship.
WebObjects is a mature, sophisticated and elegant set of frameworks  
that have been around a long time so perhaps it is time for a change  
in direction. Maybe there will be changes soon. Being so mature,  
giant upgrades should not really be expected for WebObjects and it  
doesn't help that many in the WebObjects' team have been working on  
CoreData for the past few years.

Most WO developers now use Eclipse and WOLips rather than Xcode even  
after the inclusion of the new WO tools in Xcode during WWDC 2005.  
The development tools have never been WebObjects' strong point.   
Personally I still use Xcode for WO development just because I find  
it easier to work with just one IDE but will switch to Eclipse in the  
near future. Any Java development in Xcode is definitely a less  
satisfying experience than C, Objective-C or C++ development.

I would like to see something along the lines of the ICA Club (Creative 
Network London), which I think serves as a potentially good model of a 
community representing a broad selection of media industry sectors - 
http://www.ica-theclub.com/about/

Admittedly it helps if you are backed by an organisation with the clout 
of the Institute of the Contemporary Arts and have hefty sponsors like 
Channel Four and the Arts Council behind you, but I guess setting 
something up along these lines effectively is never gonna be cheap.

As to how effective or active the ICA Club is even with this backing I 
wouldn't know - not particularly active I guess judging by how few 
entries there are in the blog - 8 since the sites launch in November..!

One thing I have always found a bit strange about the Bristol Media 
site is the fact that when you view a member's details there is an 
"edit' button at the bottom of the page which seems to suggest  you can 
edit their details - haven't actually tried it to see if it works but 
some malevolent fun could be had there if you were so inclined...!

So it would appear Protx then :-)

It does look good and the stuff to integrate it into your site using  
the Direct method looks like I could get my teeth into something  
pretty slick back-end wise for our accounting and shop people...

Have passed it on to the account dept for the once over...

Cheers for the suggestion everyone..

In theory it would be fairly rapidly undone by the admin who gets  
email notification of changes.  Similar to a wiki model, the idea is  
to make it easy to use first and deal with abuse later, rather than  
being so paranoid about abuse that you design a system that has a  
high barrier to entry and thus doesn't get used.  It will be  
interesting to see if this idea makes it into any redesign of the site.

Subject: [_] Mail aliases in webmin
Message-ID: <CC639A1B-5F3D-4E59-BDF8-E177098889C0@bristolwireless.net>

Oh wise ones, I'm setting up some mail aliases via webmin and it  
gives me a number of options for 'Alias destinations' including:
* Email address ...
* Mailbox of user ...

Suppose, for example I have a mail user 'alice' set up to receive her  
mail in her mailbox _and_ to have it forwarded to alice@elsewhere.com.

If I then set up an alias for alice, say 'whiterabbit' does it make  
any difference whether I set the destination as alice's email or  
alice's mailbox?

I'm guessing that if I choose the mailbox option it will go straight  
to her mailbox and not get forwarded elsewhere but if I choose the  
address option it will end up in her mailbox _and_ get forwarded  
elsewhere. Yes?

TIA

Yeah - I knew that PHP and Apache were already on OSX - but I presumed 
they would be out of date simple versions.

I am a designer so can I just ask if this is correct? Are darwinports 
and fink just a way of setting up complied versions PHP etc?

When I installed PHP on my PC I just downloaded the PHP package from 
PHP.net, can I not do that with Mac? I want to keep it as simple as 
possible - just want PHP and Apache so I can  build my sites with PHP?

Excuse my ignorance - I don't even know what LAMP is, but I don't think 
I need to know yet.

Agreed... my statement was a little sweeping for what is quite a  
complicated subject.  Apple's relationship to WO has been really  
quite odd since NeXT "bought" Apple.  Love-hate is just scratching  
the surface :)

I've played around with WO sporadically since it came out (back on  
NeXT kit), and have always been partial to the idea of doing a WO  
project, but have never got the opportunity.  There's a reasonably  
high mental barrier to entry with WebObjects, unless you land in a  
company that's already gone that way.

I'm not close enough to the subject to know what's going on nowadays,  
but it just seems that while the WO frameworks and Cocoa are a good  
match, there's a lot of divergence.  For example, Core Data -v- EOF,  
and Cocoa-Java being deprecated.

While PHP is far less Enterprisey than WO, it's still a competing web  
development technology, and it's tough to argue when (as far as I can  
remember) PHP has the lead on install base over everything else.

Anyway, my point is that Apache+MySQL+PHP is such an incredibly  
common technology (good or bad), and one in use by a lot of Mac-using  
web developers, I don't think it would be such a bad idea to support  
it.  Install packages for Apache, PHP and MySQL (separate and in  
combination) have been flapping around pretty much since the Public  
Beta, and they all feel slightly dirty and non-standard.

I've got nothing against Rails also being put into the Developer  
Tools as an optional package (but, please not into "Essential System  
Software", which is already a bit too bloated), along with whatever  
Python/Zope/Plone thing stays still long enough to get it on a Gold  
Master.  In fact, I'd like to see an Apple official "Web Developer  
Tools" package, which has all of the above as options, and then pull  
WO out into that.

As a result of history rather than objective judgement, I'm still  
stuck in a 90/10 PHP/Perl mindset, but I've got nothing against  
others being in there.  It might give me the impetus to actually  
start using some of the alternatives.

I can't decide whether I like Xcode or not.  I've been spending my  
time recently doing "real" application development rather than web  
stuff, and have been working in Xcode rather than my usual Emacs.   
Still not convinced either way.  Every time I've tried moving to  
Eclipse, I've ended up missing Emacs.

Incidentally, have you noticed how much of the new OSX stuff uses  
Python?  Hmmm... it might be interesting to see the relative  
proportions of AppleScript, Perl, Python and Ruby in OSX...

Yep.  100% correct.

DarwinPorts and Fink are for crusty UNIX users (such as myself) who  
insist on treating their macs like UNIX boxes (with, IIRC,  
DarwinPorts is to BSD as Fink is to Debian).  To be honest, for your  
needs they're more trouble than they're worth.

LAMP just refers to the combination of Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP,  
with MAMP being the Mac equivalent.

The MAMP package seems to be exactly what you're looking for:  a  
single easy-to-install download of all the tools you're likely to need.

The "M" in LAMP, stands for MySQL

If you dont require MySQL, your best bet is to download the PHP  
package from:

http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/

That will work with the OSX apache, so you dont have to worry about  
having extra software "doing stuff" on your machine.

Right - I'm going to have to bow out of this discussion now - cos it's 
going way over my head. I'll do a bit more googling.

But, just so I know... If I do get a macbook, would anyone in bristol be 
prepared to set up PHP and Apache for me (if I don't work it out myself) 
for money?

I might as well go MAMP cos I have been learning and practicing MySQL on

It's quite simple to set up the apache and config php here's a series
of tutorials that will walk you through the process, they are for an
older version of osx but the principles are the same.

You set it in the BIOS.

IIRC You press [DEL] as the PC is booting, and it will present you  
with an ugly as sin menu system.

You need to specify the order of boot devices, set it to be:
CD-ROM
ATA
FLOPPY

Or something along those lines (will work as long as CD-ROM is first  
on the list).

Go into the BIOS (usually keep hitting "Del" as soon as you switch the
machine on). Then look for "Boot sequence" options (often in "advanced
settings", and probably you'll find it's using the HDD before the CD-ROM.
Just change the order so the CD comes first.

Ah, now *that* was entertainment. Perhaps someone could get the people
responsible for IE7's CSS implementation over for a drink and a "chat"?
I suspect they're wise to us now, though - ah well :(

Well this is the thing see.... big wads of cash don't mean success. 
Underscore has had no funding, and has no particular aims etc and is 
pretty damn active -- this is the 42'nd post *today*

I've always wanted to keep away from trying to organise anything too big 
for underscore as it ain't broke so don't fix it.  But then Tom is 
right, these are the people who *are* the digital industry and there 
should be a way to 'leverage' (I hate the word too) the momentum here.

There have been several mentions in the past about a search in our 
archives, and Christian has been bugging me about updated templates etc. 
(yes, soon...).  but beyond that?

I think the directory in the BM site is a damn goood start, and if we 
can get a few issues with it sorted out then I think it could be really 
good.. and I think this is one big aspect of what BM can do to support 
the industry.

Underscore, on the other hand has alwats really been about *individuals* 
not companies.  Rick H has mentioned to me several ideas he's had about 
other things Underscore site could offer... and one of those (I may be 
extending, or corruptin Rick's idea... not sure) is to *alongside* the 
mailing list and archives have some kind of 'biography' or 'avatar' or 
similar for each poster.  Anybody who has used the gmane archives for 
mailing lists might have noticed that if it recognises your domain name 
then it will put your company icon up next to the post.

What if we had something similar? Reeeeeeallly simple... but what if 
your underscore email/password allowed you to login to a simple site to 
put in some simple biog info, *including* link to company profile/info 
on the BM site, links, quotes, photo etc... whatever... just a chance to 
put a bit of background about *you* and any companies/organisations you 
are part of or affiliated with.  Many people on Underscore wear several 
hats and I'm sure would be good if could link to each of those.

Then the underscore archives, would look up the posters email address 
and next to each posting would show their icon/photo/avatar, brief 
details and then link to full profile/whatever site you want.

The idea would be to *not* change underscore in any way as it currently 
works, but to just provide some ancilliary information and context.  The 
number of times searching for stuff in google and I've come across 
underscore posts is numerous... now imagine if we augmented that google 
juice with a bit of info about the people behind the posts.  To really 
show the knowledge and experience of the people in the list.

Thoughts?

-Matt

yep my idea was basically that underscore could be extended without being
changed, i.e. to add extra optional facilities that would make the archives
more useful as a website, but with no change to how the list operates, other
than that all underscore members would have the option to log onto the
website with their existing underscore username and password and add stuff
to their own area. By having the user database and archives linked up in
this way we could add some proper searching, plus make it possible for
people to tag posts, subscribe to threads or keyword search results by RSS,
loads of other clever stuff. Wrap all this up in some nice user-contributed
skins and it would be a very nice community website to sit alongside the
list.

I think it wouldnt hurt to do that stuff, I mean how can it, and you
wouldnt *have* to add anything if you didnt want to. But if we
improved the site and made it a little more of a showcasey type thing
and it gets googled then that could really make some impact I believe,
at the very least get people talking about 'that underscore lot in
bristol/bath'.

But, I also think we should make BM work for us, by supporting them
and also influencing them. One thing I was most annoyed about hearing
lately is that the new chair has some 'big ideas' and they are going
to announce them at the swanky cocktail party thing (I think we should
all go btw), personally I would have thought that it would be better
for the new ideas to be announced (especially as they are supposed to
be so radical and bring so much improvement) and a little consultation
take place? Perhaps I am wrong?

Chris Wilson did turn up for the WaSP 'open meeting' at SXSW and did a
session at @media. No real fireworks, I'm afraid. At least, nothing like has
been in the comments on his blog of late <http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/>.

I disagree, profiles are one thing. SkillSwap is another (which I'm all
for on an individual basis) as for Underscore being a collective, it's
not it's a forum, of individuals. Many of whom are actually competitors
at company level. Keep the showcases for the portfolios and company
sites.

I have some inside contacts, I definately think I could get some
interesting people to come and talk about stuff. I had a great idea
for some 'seminars' a while back and had interest from people inside
both apple and M$  along with Adobe, Macromedia (when they werent
adobe) and others. Now, if only I had the time and some funding to
sort it, I wonder what job that would be??? .............

Nothing wrong with a bit of healthy competition and the overall goal
(in my mind) would be to win bigger contracts which require
collaboration.

And people still offer help and advice to their competitors on this list?!

yep, I was thinking more resource than showcase, albeit a nice shiny

Yay! We could all have our own blogs up there too!

*slaps self very hard*

No, seriously, I'd love to upload a few bits and pieces - if this can be
done quickly & easily (or at least, fundably), sounds great. Could almost
turn it into a kind of http://www.buildersite.co.uk, with tags and stuff for
what people do (although with fewer gay porn style photos). Or have I missed
the point?

That's not Underscore IMO, If you're talking about empire building a
small company and freelance network (plenty of those come and gone while
Underscore rumbles on) to *really* go for 'bigger contracts' that's a
completely different beast which would be relevant to only some of
Underscores 'members'. It is also likely to make others uncomfortable
should it be in anyway affiliated with Underscore.

Yes, Claranet had a router on the same mains ring which had to be
powered off, disrupting their entire network earlier today for about
15 minutes.  Its all back up and working now.

Well it was only a thought that it *might* lead to that sort of thing,
I dont think its the point really either. You seem very bothered about

I've been thinking of the same kind of thing for years.  In fact,  
here's a screenshot from an abortive attempt I made in 1998:

	http://gidden.net/junk/swdb.jpg

The idea is that it would have personal, company and group profiles,  
and the mailing list was fully integrated: you could subscribe via  
email, NNTP (!) or just use the web archives.  I also put shared  
calendars in.  The whole thing was a big entity-relationship database  
so you could effectively browse through the community, or even  
generate relationship graphs (using GraphViz).  It developed from a  
prototype for intra- and extranets I put together at Brann.

I then decided to rewrite from scratch and got heavily infected with  
Second System Syndrome, ending up designing a new language to  
implement it in, as I was sick of Perl and PHP.

Nowadays, it looks like there are enough solutions to throw this kind  
of thing together well enough to use.  I'm just not convinced anyone  
would use it!


I would, however, like to see a decent archive system for the mailing  
list with a good search mechanism.  I'd happily put one together for  
you, but I don't know Zope ;)

Indeed, I *don't want to duplicate BM* I'll repeat that *I do NOT want 
to duplicate BM*.  The idea was to tie the two together a bit in a very 
lightweight way.  So for instance if you view a post from me in the 
archives then alongside the post will be a paragraph about who I am and 
what I do, and then links to Netsight, BMEX, and Netsight MCC's profiles 
on bristolmedia.co.uk.  Maybe a link to a personal blog if I had one 
etc.  I guess the kind of stuff that would often be in a .sig but 
expanded a bit.

Already done, albeit with Macromedia :)

Shortly after the Microsoft guy, some bloke came to [_], trying to  
sell Flash Generator.  Come to think of it, I think the "Flash is  
Pants" meme started there.

(Does that qualify as a meme?  Hmmm)

I seem to remember him asking me if I wanted a job with them, and I

That's great and I'd wish you the best of luck. I just don't think
Underscore is the correct vehicle. 

Certainly not bothered by competition (though I can see how it may of
come across like that). I'm all for a thriving industry and with the
amount of work everyone seems to have on at the moment that's where were
at.

Did Linx go down? There doesn't appear to be any blips on the LINX 
bandwidth graph and we didn't notice anything here so I'm guessing not. 
  But then we peer at MANAP too, so traffic would have diverted that way.

Agreed.  The first version I wrote had an incredibly complex and  
powerful ACL system for editing and viewing, allowing the site to be  
used for intranets, extranets and public sites.  It ended up so  
complex, the new language idea seemed the _easiest_ way to achieve it.

As I discovered :)

It might be worth trying to tie this into the whole RDF thing in that  
there institute not far from you, Matt.  FOAF isn't a million miles  
from what I was trying to do back then.

yep agreed - this wouldn't be in competiton with other sites just an
extension of what is already exists with underscore. and this should
definately not be just another directory that has to be maintained! No data
should need to be entered if it exists elsewhere, just a link to it or some
other type of integration - Think mashup (ooh I used my first web
2.0buzzword in a useful way!)

This is definitely the way to do things.  No point reinventing the  
wheel, engine, brakes etc.  Just add some energy to link the tool we  
have up, and therefore hopefully allow the natural buzz around  
underscore seep into the other things that could be useful.  Shared  
Calendar: BristolMediaCal? Profiles: Bristol Media?

And on a slightly different, but kind of connected theme, are many  
people using linkedIn? (http://www.linkedin.com/), is there any  
potential collaboration with this kind of social networking thing (or  
any need?!)

Mike I agree with you.  I think that sort of activity is *not* 
underscore.  That sort of bit tender organised bid stuff would best be 
done by another vehicle, Bristol Media perhaps.  But Underscore is still 
used very very much for the small scale informal stuff (I need someone 
to do X tomorrow, Help!).

It wasn't *that* shortly after the MS guy then -- the OP said the MS guy was
pimping IE 4 in '97, at which time Flash was at v 1.0 and still nothing more
than FutureSplash Animator with a (very thin) coat of Macromedia paint.
Generator didn't turn up until 2000.

Regardless, I don't suppose there's video of that one? That would be fun.
:-)

TBH, tho, I'd be more keen on beating up on them for the way they're
wrecking PS & Illustrator by tying it all in with Bridge and lawd knows what
all else.

Given that it's Mailman that underpins the operation of this list, an  
[_]
patch for Mailman, perhaps? It's only Python after all ;)

In the first instance, I'd hope we could do:

- htdig integration so we can search the archives properly,
- a finished skin for the most important pages of the MM interface

Thereafter, perhaps the list subscribers page (currently only visible
by you as list admin) could be enhanced in the limited ways you  
describe?

You just want to be able to add a few links to/data from people's
profiles on other services - Flickr, del.icio.us, LinkedIn, last.fm. A
bit of RSS magic a la SuprGlu [1] should suffice...

It's all starting to sound A Bit Web 2.0 (TM), in the nicest possible way :p

I could build it quickly and easily using a certain over-mentioned open
source CMS, as long as *someone*  (nudges Matt) can do the voodoo work in
making mailman speak to the CMS user database and search index.

<http://www.bristolmediacal.co.uk/> was created because I forget to  
go to things and wanted reminding, and some other people agreed.   
(name predates Bristol Media by the way) It needs content, like all  
these things.  We could probably make it open submission if someone  
could figure out how to hack PHPiCalendar.  Currently it's driven by  
an iCal feed from Claire's mac, and Claire is too busy to keep it up  
to date.

I've tried Linkdin and 'the other one' (forget it's name, oh SoFlow,  
I remembered).  Full of wierdo consultants, gurus and chancers as far  
as I can see.  True business trust tends to arrive on a  
recommendation from someone else trusted, not on a cold networking site.

Ah, right.

Now that you mention it, I went to some Generator seminar thingy in NYC in
early '99 or so.

Damn inaccurate Wikipedia articles. :-/

Cheers, Christian... I knew I was still at Brann at the time :)

This meeting happened after he'd tried to woo us at Brann, courtesy

What's the subject of the SkillSwap in September? Looked at the  
website and there's no mention of it yet...

Will probably show my face at this one.  Made a conscious decision to  
"get more involved in stuff" following my kids induced hibernation  
over the last three years.

Heh... I worriedly stared at the Wikipedia page too, thinking "this  
MUST be wrong", but couldn't find any evidence.  Lies, Damn Lies...  
and Wikipedia.

Anyway, best of luck, Chris.  There's also nothing to say that you  
can't spiritually stay in Bristol via Underscore. :)

Best done by private membership organisations with subscriptions  
(Spark Online, Zope Europe), would hate to see public money spent on  
this, would probably violate De Minimis rules or something anyway.

exactly.  it's fast and it's got good depth to it.

One of 'em anyway, ya.

That and the way they've been sharing their work (Nate Keochley's present at
@media was possibly the most substantive I've seen by a bigco guy talking
about their own work).

Not wanting to defend snake-oil salespeople pushing products from  
hell, but personally I'm just not that excited by the idea of  
inviting people to be bristol to be collectively rude to them.   
Wouldn't get me out of the house on a cold November evening.

Colour me weird but the idea seems childish and strange and  
represents everything that stops the mainstream (e.g. public sector  
and parts of the industry in Bristol) engaging with [_].

Why does that matter one tiny bit?  Because [_] is consistently held  
up as an amazing and successful resource and a good way to interface  
with the Bristol digital sector.  But it's also borderline hostile or  
just close minded to all kinds of people.  Not that I'd ever suggest  
[_] should change, tidy up, be presentable, be moderated: it is what  
it is.  But you reap what you sow etc. etc.

They definitely move it, not sure if it's for tax reasons, I thought it had

Not wanting to defend Tom's words (I'm sure he's plenty capable of doing
that himself) but as I recall, there was - how shall I put it? -  
vigorous
debate at most meetings. Seemed like important stuff was being  
discussed.
Nowadays, it seems we don't question what we do as much - instead, we  
get
skill-swaps to help us do the stuff we do better. The arguments  
certainly
seem tamer. Good thing? Bad thing? I dunno. Different.

It is? By whom? Perhaps it's simply long-lived? Let's not forget that  
the
more corporate-friendly networking efforts have, er, SUNK without a  
trace
as those running them moved on to other things.

For many freelancers on this list, I suspect this is just a  
substitute for
office chatter. And offices have their own intimidating aspects too. It
takes a certain confidence to speak out, wherever you are.

This is very true - certain parts of the industry in Bristol view underscore
as a place for arguing techies and hot air/ chat. Quite rightly so most of
the time, but it is also a very good forum to speak the majority of the
people involved in digital media in Bristol (and Bath). I think there is a
bit on an image problem and it would be nice if the people in the industry
who are either intimdated by underscore or completely dismissive of it (or
both) to at least feel like they could announce stuff, or ask questions on
the list. I'm not implying moderation either, but just wanted to make people
aware that underscore is percieved that way by some (inflential) people in
our own industry.

This is very true, and also a lot of nice people who would contribute
are too scared to cos they think we are all mean swines who will rip
them to pieces which is not entirely true, and i think really everyone
is just a fluffy kitten underneath.

yes.  Parallels is ace.  Load up on RAM though.  Our developers will  
be doing this soon(ish) when we switch to intel macs for dev.  Only  
they'll be looking at Plone sites (natch).

but does parallels have "host-only" networking like vmware? i.e. so you can
work disconnected from the network and have different IP addresses for the
host and the guest machine so they can see each other? Virtual PC doesn't do
this - you have to be connected to a network to view stuff being server from
a local web server on either the guest or the host.

Yeah... I don't think we were really hurling abuse as such, at least  
until the alcohol started kicking in.  It was definitely constructive  
debate.

The two guys I can think of (Microsoft and Macromedia) weren't  
actually sales-people.. more tech-evangelists, so they were pretty  
clued up.  I think the [_] gauntlet was actually reasonably  
constructive for them.  By being challenged with every possible  
difficult question, they reinforce their case.

Even though I'm not the biggest fan of their products, they were very  
interesting and informative meetings.

I seem to remember the main thing the Microsoft guy had to deal with  
was our questions about the open-sourcing of Netscape that had been  
announced earlier that day/week, and about their lack of decent CSS  
support.

Yeah.. in a way there's a case for an IRC channel, but I think it'd  
be even more destructive to productivity.

Very funny, since when do people go round wearing shoes on both  
hands... I must admit though does look rather odd.  I think I must  
have my hands in my coat or a scarf around them?

It is quite strange to see this! It was many many moons ago!

How about I turn up to the next skillswap just to prove I have arms  
that really are quite normal ; )

Might be stating the obvious, but I wouldn't condone that; it'd be another
barrier to entry, and the signal-to-noise ratio would drop
dramatically--assuming the logs were even made public in the first place.
(And if they weren't then I'd definitely be vocal against implementing it.)

we have an IRC server at irc.ramtops.org - there was a brief flurry of an
[_] channel a few years ago, and it didn't really catch on.  But all are
welcome if they want even more displacement activity :)

Another quick suggestion -

Go here - http://serverlogistics.com/downloads.php and download  
Complete Apache 2 and Complete PHP. Install the pair of them and you  
have a working, easy to use Apache2/PHP installation that can be  
controlled from the System Preferences panel. If you also want MySQL  
installing, there's a Complete MySQL.

Highly recommended and dead easy.

WTF? IRC logs are generally not made public and it's a forum for the  
sort
of social chaff that can clutter up the list and noddy FAQ's.

Subject: [_] O2, Bluetooth and GPRS
Message-ID: <e0a1b7230608171419i1095e43dyf1d0ab698b8fff6f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Ive been bumbling around for the past hour trying to get this to work,
and thus far Ive failed - so its out to you guys :)

I have a standard 750 minute/750 text 18 month contact with O2, along
with 1GB monthly browse and download allowance.  Ive been told that
this allowance also includes GPRS traffic....

So, Ive been trying to get my Mac (10.4.7 Macbook) to connect via my
phone (w810i) to the internet as it could be useful on the go.
Utterly failed so far.

The Mac wants the CID number, which I have no idea how to get hold of
- Googling shows some possibilities but the phone has no 'CID' field
anywhere.

Have any of you done this?  Is it possible?  Am I barking up the wrong
tree in the wrong forest?

O2.co.uk is useless.

Cheers
Richard

I've been using them for over 5 years with no problems. Up till last 
month when they 'forgot' to renew one of my domains with Nominet for 2 
months after I'd paid it up, leading to it expiring on a Friday and 
being off the air until the following Monday.

Consider me not amused, but hopefully it was an isolated incident.
