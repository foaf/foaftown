OK, idea is to do merges between data describing (recent, for eg) posts 
to _, and profiles loaded from elsewhere. We purposefully don't care 
much about the elsewhere, ... since there could be for eg various 
competing/complimentary Bristol-oriented directories, portals, wikis, or 
whatever, covering different aspects.

What we want, basically, is some useful bits and pieces to pretty up the 
recent post archives, and to help people get a bit more sense of "who is 
who" around here, without these experiments interfering with the nature 
of _ itself.

So, http://spypixel.com/2006/_/gid/_who.rdf is a dump of info about 
posters, using RDF (FOAF and Dublin Core). It has mailboxes and 
hashes-of-mailboxes. Now, got to find some profile info, at least for 
prototyping.
