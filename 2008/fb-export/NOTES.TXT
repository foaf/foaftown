Matthew Rowe's PHP code

NOTE: I've included FB's libraries here, alongside Matthew's GPL stuff.

These shouldn't be packaged together (the sourceforge code doesn't include the FB libs). Am just trying 
to get this running first.

Stuff  I'd like to see added:

1. get codepiction and other info out
2. two modes: "might go public" vs "be careful and don't leak this" with birthday or whatever info (Scoble mode? :)
3. Bloom filter experiments
