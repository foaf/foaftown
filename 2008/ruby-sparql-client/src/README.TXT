This is a Ruby version of Ivan Herman's Python client for the SPARQL query protocol.

STATUS: not fit for use yet


See Ivan's page: http://ivanherman.wordpress.com/2007/07/06/sparql-endpoint-interface-to-python/
Original code: http://www.ivan-herman.net/Misc/PythonStuff/SPARQL/

I ommitted the geonames stuff. I have not done any of the XML parsing either. It kinda handles JSON, except the values seem oddly truncated. 
I have only tested with http://arc.semsol.org/ (ARC2), which seems to be truncating some values in the JSON.

Todo: sync with Ivan, put appropriate license files in, commit to svn.

Very much a work in progress. Help welcomed!!!
