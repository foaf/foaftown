This directory contains some experiments with music preference summarisation.

It was originally hacked during non-attendance of BBC hackday.

It uses Last.fm API plus some data from the BBC that is being contributed to
MusicBrainz, which associated MusicBrainz artist IDs with high level genres.

The .txt file is (c) BBC/MusicBrainz etc; please see my blog post for sourcing
and attribution.

I believe the MB/BBC data is being added to MB's tags dataset, and licensed
Creative Commons Non-Commercial. Getting this made broader to allow commercial 
use could be worthwhile.

For other sources of music pref data, consider YouTube APIs, 
http://danbri.org/words/2008/06/27/351

...and MySpace APIs, Facebook, OpenSocial etc schemas.
