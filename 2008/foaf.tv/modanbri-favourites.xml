        <title type="text">Palin's Churches and the Holy Laughter anointing</title>
        <content type="text">From the research team that made the international viral video hit that
            in May 2008, according to the New York Times (and a wide range of other media including
            the LA Times, The Wall Street Journal, AP, the Dallas Morning News, CNN and MSNBC)
            forced Senator John McCain to renounce the political endorsement of Texas megachurch
            Pastor John Hagee, also head of Christians United For Israel. The 3:40 video featured an
            excerpt from a late 2005 sermon, broadcast internationally and sold by Hagee's ministry
            as a DVD, in which Hagee stated that "God sent a hunter - Hitler was a hunter" and
            suggested the divinely appointing mission was to drive Europe's Jews to Palestine
            because that was, according to Hagee, "God's top priority". ( NYT story :
            http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/us/politics/23hagee.html ) Documentation for the
            "Palin's Churches and The Holy Laughter Anointing" video, along with articles on the
            religious doctrines held at at least 3 of four out of Palin's Alaska churches, please
            see : http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/9/11/113733/968 See the first video in the
            series, Palin's Demon Haunted Churches (removed by YouTube) at
            http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/9/5/03830/11602/ From the research team that
            brought you Palin's Demon Haunted Churches and John Hagee's sermons. ( currently hosted
            at : http://www.vimeo.com/1264130 ) Palin's Demon Haunted Churches, also listed as Sarah
            Palin's Churches and the Third Wave (currently removed by YouTube for reasons unknown to
            the researchers) focused on the links between Wasilla Assembly of God and leaders and
            organizations of the Third Wave or New Apostolic Reformation, including Morningstar
            Ministries. This movement is the resurgence of a heresy condemned by the General Council
            of the Assemblies of God in 1949 and again in a resolution in 2000. Palin's Churches and
            the Holy Laughter Anointing : The new movie, Palin's Churches and the Holy Laughter
            Anointing, focuses on Juneau Christian Center, formerly Bethel Assembly of God, and the
            pastor's relationship with Rodney Howard-Browne. Howard-Browne is the world leader in
            the anointing of Holy Laughter but also a fierce proponent of the Third Wave's belief
            that they must take over the United States and the world before the end times. When in
            residence in Juneau, Sarah Palin has chosen to attend Juneau Christian Center as
            documented by the church, and by the Alaska Assemblies of God state newsletter, Alaska
            Update. Rodney Howard-Browne is recognized worldwide as the source of Holy Laughter
            anointing to revivals around the globe. He has become a central figure in the Third
            Wave, also known as the New Apostolic Reformation, and is credited with bringing Holy
            Laughter to the Toronto Airport Blessing and the Lakeland Outpouring. Howard-Browne is
            also a long time associate of Mike Rose, senior pastor of Juneau Christian Center,
            formerly the Bethel Assembly of God. Mike Rose has been the Alaska State Legislature
            Chaplain since 1994 and has espoused Christian nationalist sentiments since that date,
            when he offered the following prayer, May 5, 1994 on the AK Senate floor: "Our society's
            rejection of biblical principles and truth has placed our country in spiritual and moral
            jeopardy. Our need for revival and renewal is great, but you said in Your word, 'If my
            people who are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and
            turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins,
            and will heal their land.' "</content>

        <title type="text">WE RUN THIS.</title>
        <content type="text">Hello leaders of scientology, we are anonymous. We hope you are having
            as much fun with this as we are. As you know, we are still here, and with every passing
            day your failure to account for the fraud and abuse exposed by our campaign becomes more
            evident to the media, to our government and to your own followers. Reuters , The BBC
            ,CNN, The London Times, Fox, The Associated Press, Forbes and a legion of local news
            agencies have chosen to communicate our message about your organization to their
            viewer-ship. And now the world is listening to us and watching you. The mechanism behind
            the phenomenal ease with which we have achieved this is simple. We are speaking the
            truth. Your efforts to handle this condition are as predictable as they are expensive
            for you. This pleases Anonymous and we encourage you to continue waging your
            informational war against truth at great expense to you and at no cost to us. We approve
            of these conditions. Because within them defeat is impossible. Our campaign has been one
            of constant success, and yours has been one of constant failure. This will continue.
            Evidence of our victory is everywhere. We are certain that Youtube and google appreciate
            your handsome patronage now necessary because of the ubiquity of our message.
            Unfortunately for you the hundreds of thousands of dollars you now spend every month
            because of Anonymous cannot change your organization's history of crime and abuse of
            human rights, nor alter your organizations policy encouraging criminal behavior which
            are now all available to the public. Your lawsuits to censor these documents will
            continue to fail at great cost to you just as your attempts to paint our peaceful
            demonstrations as terrorist activities have done nothing but foreground your tendency to
            abuse the judicial system to suppress free speech. Defections at every level of your
            organization will continue to increase. By now you have most likely experienced the
            cognition that every action we take deprives you of at least one of the three following
            things: capital, clients and credibility. These conditions will continue to exert their
            pressure upon you and your superiors. The disorder will continue to deepen. We have
            changed the rules of the game. Growth of the magnitude required to maintain your
            organization in its present form is no longer possible for you. Your ability to seduce
            the public has been destroyed. Your survival has long depended on your capacity to
            suppress the truth of your abuses, and that ability is now gone. We have removed it.
            Leaders of scientology, the data has spoken. We are at Cause. you are at effect. Expect
            this to continue, and thank you for playing the game. THIS CHANNEL WILL BE CENSORED.

        <title type="text">Palin's Church May Have Shaped Controversial Worldview</title>
        <content type="text">Three months before she was thrust into the national political
            spotlight, Gov. Sarah Palin was asked to handle a much smaller task: addressing the
            graduating class of commission students at her one-time church, Wasilla Assembly of God.
            Her speech in June provides as much insight into her policy leanings as anything
            uncovered since she was asked to be John McCain's running mate. Speaking before the
            Pentecostal church, Palin painted the current war in Iraq as a messianic affair in which
            the United States could act out the will of the Lord. "Pray for our military men and
            women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders,
            our national leaders, are sending [U.S. soldiers] out on a task that is from God," she
            exhorted the congregants. "That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that
            there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan."</content>

            <media:title type="plain">Palin's Church May Have Shaped Controversial Worldview</media:title>
            <media:description type="plain">Three months before she was thrust into the national
                political spotlight, Gov. Sarah Palin was asked to handle a much smaller task:
                addressing the graduating class of commission students at her one-time church,
                Wasilla Assembly of God. Her speech in June provides as much insight into her policy
                leanings as anything uncovered since she was asked to be John McCain's running mate.
                Speaking before the Pentecostal church, Palin painted the current war in Iraq as a
                messianic affair in which the United States could act out the will of the Lord.
                "Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for
                this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending [U.S. soldiers]
                out on a task that is from God," she exhorted the congregants. "That's what we have
                to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is
                God's plan."</media:description>

        <title type="text">Salman Abu Sitta: The Geography of Occupation</title>
        <content type="text">Professor Salman H. Abu-Sitta of the London-based Palestine Land
            Society gives a personal account of how he became a refugee in Palestine in 1948. Using
            data from his research, Abu-Sitta shows how over 600 Palestinian villages were
            systematically depopulated by the advancing Israeli forces, leaving many others
            dismembered by an arbitrary cease-fire line. With maps and demographic statistics,
            Abu-Sitta shows that, in effect, Zoinist policies were an ethnic cleasing campaign that
            resulted in a massive transfer of native Palestinians to the countries bordering Israel,
            where thousands remain within 100 miles from their original communities. Producer: Ed

            Kevin Marks, Brad Fitzpatrick (Google) Using email addresses to identify people has a
            problem - email addresses can be used to send, not receive. With the rise of blogs and
            social networks, millions of people are using URLs to refer to themselves and others.
            The Social Graph API indexes these sites and their connections, enabling this web-wide

            express connections, how we index them, and how OpenID combines with The Social Graph
            API to help connect people on the web to your applications, and save your users from

        <content type="text">Info-A species of shark rarely seen alive because its natural habitat
            is about 2,000 feet under the sea was captured on film by staff at a Japanese marine
            park this week. The Awashima Marine Park in Shizuoka, south of Tokyo, was alerted by a
            fisherman at a nearby port on Sunday that he had spotted an odd-looking eel-like
            creature with a mouthful of needle-sharp teeth. Marine park staff caught the 5 foot (1.6
            meter) long creature, which they identified as a female frilled shark, sometimes
            referred to as a "living fossil" because it is a primitive species that has changed
            little since prehistoric times. The shark appeared to be in poor condition when park
            staff moved it to a seawater pool where they filmed it swimming and opening its jaws.
            "We believe moving pictures of a live specimen are extremely rare," said an official at
            the park. "They live between 1,968 and 3,280 feet (600 and 1,000 meters) under the
            water, which is deeper than humans can go." "We think it may have come close to the
            surface because it was sick, or else it was weakened because it was in shallow waters,"
            the official said. Copyright 2007 Reuters. Video- ITV News Wednesday January 24-2007
