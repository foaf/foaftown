<h2>Flickr groups on Google Earth</h2>
<p>This page describes some experimental <a href=
"http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> data feeds that I've
made available for a few region-based Flickr groups. If you have
Google Earth installed, and a high-bandwidth 'net connection, the
following <a href="http://earth.google.com/kml/">KML</a> links will
overlay some photos on the globe, where the photos are public,
posted to one of the selected Flickr group pools below, and tagged
with their location.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please be aware that this is a work in
progress, and that the usability and reliability of these feeds
should be improved in the future.</p>
<p>Links below are to Flickr pages, followed by the link for Google
Earth. If you don't have Google Earth, you can still check out the
photos via Flickr's Web interface by following the 'map' link.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>Flickr is a popular photo-sharing service owned by Yahoo. Their
photo organizer has a facility for "tagging" a photo with its
location, allowing you to see it using Yahoo maps displayed within
Flickr. Since they also allow external software to read this
information, we can write tools that display photos in other ways.
All we have here is the result of reading some photo descriptions
from the Flickr site, and generating files that Google Earth can
understand.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<p>I've <a href=

a few screenshots</a> to Flickr.

The images here are of Buenos Aires, and also show some great 3d models 
and maps 
from <a

work</a>.

<h2>Issues</h2>
<dl>
<dt>250 photo limit</dt>
<dd>The main issue we have is that currently we only grab
information about 250 geo-tagged photos per pool. This is enough to
get a feel for the possibilities, without overloading either Google
Earth viewer, or the Flickr Web service.</dd>
<dt>Usability</dt>
<dd>The usability of the current system is questionable. Ideas for
improvements would be welcomed.</dd>
<dt>Image loading</dt>
<dd>Images can take several seconds to load, both the small image
displayed on the globe, and the larger image visible within the
placemark. This can be confusing.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>No claim to originality here. Here's how this version works. This bit is for
technical developers, programmers and the terminally curious.</p>
<p>The software is all <a href=
"http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/geo/photos/">available
online</a> if you're interested in the detail. There isn't much to
it. It's a hack. The basic idea here was to experiment with an
approach to consuming photo data that was neutral between Web
service and "data dump" approaches. If we have a local repository
of photo metadata (from Flickr eg. via Aaron Straup Cope's <a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/~ascope/Net-Flickr-Backup-2.6/">Net::Flickr::Backup</a>,
or from elsewhere), we should also be able to generate maps, 3d
globe overlays, HTML pages etc., regardless of where the data comes
from.</p>
<p>So what we've tried here (and big thanks to Danny Ayers for XSLT
help) is the idea of using W3C's SPARQL RDF query interface as a
datasource abstraction. <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> provides a
language for querying aggregated Web data, structured in terms of
the RDF graph data model. It looks a bit like SQL, in that it
begins with the word "SELECT" and returns tables of fieldname/value
bindings. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-dawg-uc/">use
cases</a> and <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">protocol</a> documents
are worth a look if you're interested in this area. Here we focus
on the idea that many Flickr Web Service API calls result in a
structure very similar to a SPARQL resultset. Basically, a set of
"hits", each one of which carries a collection of field/value
pairs.</p>
<p>What we've done is convert Flickr's data structures into one
that might have come from running a SPARQL RDF query. We didn't
even write the query yet. But we imagine that we have one that
returns a table of results with named fields as columns, and each
photo corresponding to one row.</p>
<p>SPARQL comes with a simple XML format for representing such
tables of results, the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/">SPARQL Query Results XML
Format</a>. There is also a version of the format expressed as JSON
(ie. a scripting-language friendly subset of Javascript): see the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-json-res/">Serializing
SPARQL Query Results in JSON</a> spec.</p>
<p>At the moment, what we do is run Danny's XSLT to generate JSON in the SPARQL idiom.
And then consume the JSON in a Ruby script. Since Flickr itself
also offers a JSON resultset format, this might appear rather
longwinded and bloodyminded. Why not just generate the KML from
code than runs directly over Flickr's own JSON? Basically, because
we don't want to be bothering Flickr's Web Service so frequently.
It's better to put a little bit of abstraction between code that
generate user interface, and code that knows about a particular
datasource.</p>
<p>The working hypothesis here is that RDF/SPARQL can provide such
an abstraction, and that a cleaned-up successor to this code should
be able to do interesting things with RDF data from running
something like the Perl CPAN Net::Flickr::Backup tool against a
Flickr pool. And that this could run from local machine, without
the need to have a local implementation of the Flickr Web Service
APIs. Or we might not be using Flickr at all. Geotags might come
from elsewhere, eg. <a href=
"http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/geo/photos/old/geoloc_media.pl">
a little Perl code</a> can reconcile GPS tracklogs with
timestamped-photos.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
Here is a <a href="http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/geo/photos/examples/_fdata.xml">Flickr API response in XML</a>. What might this look like, if we pretend it was the result of running a SPARQL query against some RDF? Here are <a href="http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/geo/photos/examples/_fdata_sparql.xml">XML</a> and <a href="http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/geo/photos/examples/_fdata_json.js">JSON</a> versions of this structure. 
</p>
<p>TODO: compare/contrast with Flickr's native JSON output</p>


<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Currently, when we get more than 250 photos back from querying
Flickr, it comes in several pages. At the moment we stop at the
first page, ... but it would be nice to represent <em>all</em>
photos from a group. At this point I think we should drop XSLT, and
write adaptor code that consumes JSON and wraps the result of
several "pages" of photo descriptions to look like SPARQL JSON. I'd
also like to offer ability to run something like this tool for more
ad-hoc groups (eg. several Flickr pools, or a person plus their
friends). At some point this will mean moving to a more dynamic KML
generation strategy (the current system rebuilds 6 KML files on a
crontab schedule). There is also plenty more that could be done to
improve the Google Earth KML side of things. Perhaps representing
people and groups as fictional GE "features" orbiting in space, for
example? Suggestions as ever welcomed...</p>
<p>Maybe this deserves a Flickr group for discussion /
development?</p>
