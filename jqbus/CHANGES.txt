 * Updated to use Jena 2.5.3 including the ResultSetFormatter which was pre-release when this was originally coded.
 
 * Updated to use latest Smack library (3.0.x) in lib/ and tested with LiveJournal Jabber accounts.

 * Reluctantly updated to use Java 5, required by Smack.

 * Added a method to QueryClient allowing app to pass in a handler that gets called when we have a response (untested).
	public void sendQuery(String jid, String query, MessageListener handler) 
   ...this may be a conceptual confusion; hard to test when offline!

* Added ant build task for javadoc generation.

 * Factored out most of the client code into QueryClient class. 
   Can now more easily address different jids with different 
   queries.
   
 * Factored out server code into QueryServer class. Can now 
   more easily configure additional data files
 
 * Removed extra copy of xmlpull parser jar
 
 * Tweaked build file adding client and server targets to 
   simplify command line.
   
   To set Jabber password create a file called build.properties 
   next to build.xml and add the following:
   
   foaftown.pwd=PASSWORD
   
   This file will be used to hold other config when running via 
   Ant.
   
   ant client, or ant server will then run the appropriate app.
