  <h1>JQbus</h1>

  <h2>JQbus - Jabber chat for query services</h2>

  <p>JQbus uses off-the-shelf Jabber chat services as a generic
  information bus, passing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> queries and results via user
  accounts, encoded as <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html#stanzas-semantics-iq">XMPP IQ</a> messages.</p>

  <h3>Documentation</h3>

  <p>See the <a href="README.txt">README.txt</a> for overview,
  <a href="CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a> for progress reports, and
  the <a href="doc/index.html">javadoc</a> for API detail. This is
  experimental code; assume nothing works, and maybe you'll be
  pleasantly suprised. This code <a href=
  "http://danbri.org/words/2005/08/24/132">began</a> with a
  <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2005-08.html#2005-08-30T12:07">
  conversation</a> with Peter Saint-Andre about binding SPARQL to
  Jabber, and an implementation I started and Leigh Dodds kindly helped clean up. 
  Chris Schmidt has a nice <a href=
  "http://crschmidt.net/semweb/sparqlxmpp/">implementation</a> of
  Peter's original design using Python/Redland. This Java
  implementation uses a slightly different binding. Hopefully we
  can converge these and other implementations...</p>

  <h3>Familiar Looking Cloud Diagram</h3>

  <p>We've all been drawing such diagrams for years. The
  justification for this one is as a way to explain how "Semantic
  Desktop" efforts might plug into a story for broader access to
  personal data on the Semantic Web. Loosly: efforts like
  Nepomuk-KDE and Gnowsis are providing an RDF view of much desktop
  data, through which descriptions of photos, audio/video,
  calendars, addressbooks etc might be made available - selectively
  - to friends, colleagues and software working on behalf of those
  people. JQbus is an experimental toy for exposing desktop data in
  this fashion, using off-the-shelf Jabber accounts. The other
  services sketched in the diagram are part of a bigger unwritten
  story for how this infrastructure facilitates decentralised
  social networks. Short version: social networks are about people,
  not commercial websites. They can't be bought nor sold, nor
  fenced in :) But anyway...</p>

  <h4>Protocol Overview</h4>


<p>From <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html#stanzas-semantics-iq">RFC-3920</a>:
<blockquote>
Info/Query, or IQ, is a request-response mechanism, similar in some ways to HTTP. The semantics of IQ enable an entity to make a request of, and receive a response from, another entity. The data content of the request and response is defined by the namespace declaration of a direct child element of the IQ element, and the interaction is tracked by the requesting entity through use of the 'id' attribute.
</blockquote>
</p>
  <p>The <a href="README.txt">README</a> has more details on the protocol. To be real sure, see the code. Sorry! :)</p>


  <p>This diagram gives an overview of the Jabber conversations undertaken by
  an installation playing the "server" role; since it is a real
  Jabber account, other things can also be seen. This gives an idea
  of the data environment in which this code finds itself (eg.
  presence info from friends on the roster aka buddylist).</p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

 <p>
 There is Java src in subversion <a href="http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/jqbus/">in Subversion</a>. 
 The <a href="http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/downloads/">downloads</a> area should have
 <a href="http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/downloads/jqbus-latest.tar.gz">latest</a> code bundle. There 
 have been no numbered releases yet. 
</p>

<p>Even stalkers and historians have better things to do than read the pre-Subversion <a href="http://rdfweb.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/foafproject/htdocs/2005/code/foaftown/jabber/src/com/xmlns/foaftown/">cvs logs</a>. Forgive
me for not migrating them. And thanks once more to Leigh Dodds for cleaning up that old mess!</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>Read the README. Or if you're feeling lucky:</p>

<pre>
wget -nd http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/downloads/jqbus-latest.tar.gz
tar -zxvf jqbus-latest.tar.gz 
cd jqbus/

# Configure accounts (server_jid and client_jid):
vi src/com/xmlns/foaftown/FoafJabberNode.java 

# Run in server role:
#
ant -Dfoaftown.pwd=xxxxxx -Dfoaftown.role=server

# Run in client role (wait 30 secs for the server, and do this in another terminal window):
#
ant -Dfoaftown.pwd=xxxxxx -Dfoaftown.role=client

# Gasp in amazement as stuff scrolls up the screen...
# ...
</pre>
