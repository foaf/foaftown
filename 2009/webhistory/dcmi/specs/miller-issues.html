<h2>Issues of Document Description in HTML</h2>Eric J. Miller<BR><em>Office of Research, OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc., Dublin, Ohio<BR></em></center><BODY>
<H2>1.0	Introduction</H2>
<P>The rapid development of the World Wide Web and the electronic
dissemination of information offers opportunities and burdens.  The
opportunity is to provide unprecedented access to information with the
flexibility and convenience of networked data offers.  The burden,
however, is to integrate these services with organizational frameworks
that will allow these opportunities to become a reality.</P>
<P>HTML (HyperText Markup Language), a simple application of SGML-like
markup, is a method for expressing document structure in
the WWW  <A HREF="#Berners-Lee">[Berners-Lee]</A>.  Its
simplicity has contributed to its popularity and made Web publishing
more accessible, but that same simplicity makes it difficult to richly
describe documents. This description is increasingly important for
effective resource discovery and retrieval as more and more networked
data becomes available.</P>
<P>Object characterization ranges from automated full-text indexing to
rich AACR2  <A HREF="#AACR2">[AACR2]</A> description,
the encoding rules used by most library catalogers.  Effective
description, validation, maintenance and duplication are all issues
that will contribute to the growth of the information landscape.  This
report discusses some of the issues of document description in
HTML. </P>
<H2>2.0	The HTML 2.0 META Element</H2>
<P>Embedded description in HTML documents is currently facilitated
through the use of the 
 <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_5.html#SEC5.2.5">
META</A> element tag.  This element was originally designed to provide
a means to "discover that the data set exists and how it might be
obtained or accessed" and to "document the content, quality, and
features of a data set, indicating its fitness for use"
 <A HREF="#Berners-Lee">[Berners-Lee]</A>. </P>
<P>HTML 2.0 defines the META element with the attributes
HTTP-EQUIV, NAME and CONTENT.  The corresponding structure of the META element 
is defined by the following DTD (Document Type Definition):</P>
<pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT META - O EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST META
        HTTP-EQUIV  NAME    #IMPLIED
        NAME        NAME    #IMPLIED
        CONTENT     CDATA   #REQUIRED    &gt;
</pre><P>The HTTP-EQUIV attribute binds the element to an HTTP header field.
The NAME attribute contains the name of the element. The CONTENT
element contains the associated data.  These attributes allow the user
a limited ability to describe a particular document.</P>
<H2>3.0	Current Uses of the META Element</H2>
<P>Currently, no widely supported guidelines exist that describe the
use of the META element for the embedded description of HTML
documents.  The lack of these guidelines has created a wide range of
localized use.  One use is, as intended, to facilitate discovery and
retrieval of document collections.  Examples of localized
implementations that utilize the META element for this purpose include
the  <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WebSoft/MOMspider/">MOMspider</A> project,
the  <A HREF="http://math.binghamton.edu/MATH/docs/index.html">WN</A> server, and
 <A HREF="http://www.nexor.co.uk/public/aliweb/aliweb.html">ALIWEB</A> to
name but a few.  The lack of a common descriptive element set,
however, potentially compromises the effectiveness of interoperating
between these systems.</P>
<P> A different use of the META element is found in  <A HREF="http://www2.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html">
Netscape's push-pull</A> implementation. The META element, in this
case, is used to define a refresh duration and possible redirection of
an HTML document.  <A HREF =
"http://www.firstfloor.com">FirstFloor</A> additionally uses the
META element for refreshing "bulletins" or messages that automatically
notify users of new information on a Web site.  </P>
<P>
Additionally,  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft's
Internet Assistant</A> creates and embeds META values in HTML documents
based on the software version and the user's configuration of
Microsoft Word.</P>
<H2>4.0	Current Document Description: The META Issue(s)</H2>
<P> Given the variety of current implementations and the potential
future uses, it is important to define a framework that will allow for
both an effective object description and both localized and
distributed extensions.  It is difficult, however, to anticipate all
the possible descriptive elements or formats that will facilitate
discovery and retrieval of localized and global networked information.
The limitations of the basic attribute-value pairing allowed with the
META element makes this general, descriptive framework extremely
difficult to achieve.  The following examples illustrate some of the
problems describing an object within the confines of the current META
design.</P>
<pre>
&lt;META NAME = "Title"	CONTENT = "On the Pulse of Morning"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Author" CONTENT = "Maya Angelou"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Publisher" CONTENT = 
"University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "OtherAgent" CONTENT = 
"University of Virginia Electronic Text Center"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Date" CONTENT = "1993"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Object" CONTENT = "Poem"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Form" CONTENT = "1 ASCII file"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Source" CONTENT = "Newspaper stories and oral performance 
of text at the presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Language" CONTENT = "English"&gt;
</pre><P>This example represents an embedded HTML description of Maya
Angelou's transcribed speech at the 1993 presidential inauguration.
The descriptive elements are based on the Dublin Core element set.
The Dublin Core is a set of thirteen metadata elements that originated
from discussions at OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop  <A HREF="#Weibel">[Weibel]</A>. Among the elements are: author, title,
publisher, subject, unique identifier or electronic location,
language, date, relation to similar objects, physical form, spatial
coverage and temporal duration.  The meaning of these elements can
be understood by users with no training in formal cataloging or
established record formats and can be used to create descriptions of
Internet resources that are more detailed than automatically generated
indexes.</P>
<P>The first problem that becomes apparent is actually classifying the
appropriate element set used for the description.  This example is
based on the Dublin Core element set which focuses on the
bibliographic characterization of the object.  A variety of different
descriptive schemes will emerge that focus on other types of metadata
information including transactional, terms and conditions and ratings.
Therefore it is necessary to distinguish between these types of
classification schemes.  The syntax and structure necessary to
distinguish classification schemes would require agreement in the HTML
standards community, however for illustrative purposes, the previous
example could simply prepend the following identifier to signify the
Dublin Core descriptive scheme.</P>
<pre> 
&lt;META NAME = "Citation" CONTENT = "Dublin Core"&gt;
</pre><P>For effective searching of large collections of objects, defining
controlled vocabularies and classification schemes may become
increasingly important.  Controlled vocabularies when defining
subjects, for example, become particularly useful when classifying
knowledge domains.  For example, the subject element could be
qualified by a scheme, which specifies adherence to a known
classification system such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH), the Dewey Decimal System (DDC), or the Art and Architecture
Thesaurus.  The following examples illustrate this. </P>
<pre>
&lt;META NAME = "Subject" SCHEME = "LCSH" CONTENT = "UNIX (computer system)"&gt;
&lt;META NAME = "Subject" SCHEME = "DDC" CONTENT = "004.251"&gt;
</pre><p>Descriptive element schemes will evolve as networked information
becomes more prevalent and the functional requirements of
interoperability and access to distributed information become more of
a reality.  Classification schemes, classification types, and
versioning information become increasingly important as a basis for
effective description and to facilitate the transition among evolving
descriptive schemes.  Additional information about metadata element
schemes, types, and versions is addressed in the OCLC/NCSA Metadata
Workshop position paper <A HREF="#Weibel">[Weibel]</A>.  The following HTML DTD fragment representing the META
element provides a redefinition of the structure and
corresponding attribute information as a result of these metadata
discussions.</P>
<pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT META	- O 	EMPTY &gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST META
        HTTP-EQUIV  	NAME   	#IMPLIED
        NAME       	NAME   	#IMPLIED
	VERSION		NAME	#IMPLIED
        TYPE      	NAME   	#IMPLIED
        SCHEME      	NAME   	#IMPLIED
        CONTENT     	CDATA  	#REQUIRED    &gt;
</pre><P>For additional examples and discussions about the
Dublin Core element set see appendix 1.</P>
<H2>5.0	Possible Directions of Document Description</H2>
<P>When the META element is coupled with the VERSION, SCHEME and TYPE
attributes, potential for effective bibliographic description is
increased.  However it still provides only a limited framework for
describing HTML documents.  For detailed cataloging, a more flexible
framework is needed.</P>
<P>Descriptive information may be found either internal or external to
the actual HTML document.  A combination of both internal and external
description is additionally possible based proposed HTML extensions
that are currently being reviewed by the working group.  The following
sections discuss some of the various framework issues associated with 
both internally and externally referenced descriptive information.</P>
<H3>5.1	External Description: The LINK Element</H3>
<P>This framework could be developed by externally
referencing metadata information associated with the object.  An
example of this type of referencing, based on the HyperText LINKs proposal 
 <A HREF="#Maloney">[Maloney]</A>
is shown in the following example:</P>
<pre> 
&lt;LINK REL=META HREF="http://foo.bar/paper.marc"&gt; 
</pre><P>A potential drawback to the external referencing of descriptive
information is one of managing document modifications and versions.
The ability to have documents independent of their descriptive
information allows for modifications to be made to the document that
are not reflected in the descriptive. Additional frameworks may be 
required to handle versioning of documents.</P>
<P>Another issue associated with externally referencing descriptive
information is the additional protocol access required to identify the
bibliographic characteristics of an object.  Additionally, the
potential problem of document migration exists.  The Uniform Resource
Locator, or URL, can change due to hardware reconfiguration, file
system reorganization, or changes in organizational structure.  The
unpredictable mobility of Internet resources is inconvenient.  For
librarians, it is a serious problem which compromises their service to
patrons and imposes an unacceptably large burden on catalog
maintenance.  Continuing work in the Uniform Resource Name (URN)
communities, and the recent introduction of the PURL  <A HREF="#PURL">[PURL]</A> services are designed to solve
these problems. However, much work still is needed.</P>
<P>A potential benefit of external referencing is that the descriptive
encoding standard is independent of the HTML document, thus current
markup schemes including MARC  <A HREF="#MARC">[MARC]</A>, TEI  <A HREF="#TEI">[TEI]</A>, and
FGDC  <A HREF="#FGDC">[FGDC]</A>, could be readily
used.  Additionally, formatting and rendering issues of the
bibliographic information are no longer a concern.  </P>
<H3>5.2	Internal and External Description</H3>
<P>External referencing additionally provides an attractive framework
for a modular, inherent framework for cataloging.  This type of
cataloging has been discussed by several authors including Heaney
 <A HREF="#Heaney">[Heaney]</A> and Tillett  <A HREF="#Tillett">[Tillett]</A>.  For example, a collection of
similar objects might share a particular cataloging "class".  This
"class" could then be referenced by all of the objects in a collection
with only the intrinsic cataloging information, local to the object,
documented.  Thus each local object would inherit the bibliographic
information identified in the shared bibliographic record.</P>
<P>The following is an hypothetical example of bibliographic
inheritance based on records created by the University of Virginia
Library's Electronic Text Center. (For a description of that project,
see Gaynor  <A HREF="#Gaynor">[Gaynor]</A>).</P>

<H3>5.3	Internal Description: Place-holders and
Content-Negotiation</H3>
<P>Storing descriptive information internal to the document solves the
problem of resource migration that is associated with external
linking.  Additionally this type of storage provides a much simpler
framework for handling document versions and updates.  The
requirements of storing descriptive information internal to a HTML
document however requires a "place-holder" framework for this
descriptive information.  Issues regarding implementation, acceptance
and backward compatibility of this internal descriptive framework is
discussed in the following sections.</P>
<H4>5.3.1	Place-holders</H4>
<P>One possibility for providing flexibility is to to define a
"place-holder" for this descriptive component.  An additional element
(e.g., CITATION) in the HEAD of the document an area for arbitrarily
rich embedded description of a document may be defined the following
example.  Maya Angelou's transcribed speech is described using a DTD
that resulted from the OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop.  The DTD from this
workshop is found in appendix 2.</P>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//NEW DTD HTML//EN"&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt; Transcription of Maya Angelou's "On the Pulse of Morning" &lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;CITATION SCHEME = "Dublin Core" VERSION = "0.1"&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt; On the Pulse of Morning&lt;/&gt;
&lt;AUTHOR SCHEME = "AACR2"&gt; Angelou, Maya &lt;/&gt;
&lt;PUBLISHER&gt;University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center&lt;/&gt;
&lt;OTHERAGENT TYPE="TRANSCRIBER"&gt; University of Virginia Electronic 
Text Center&lt;/&gt;
&lt;DATE SCHEME = &gt; 1993 &lt;/&gt;
&lt;OBJECT&gt; Poem &lt;/&gt;
&lt;FORM&gt; 1 ASCII file &lt;/&gt;
&lt;SOURCE&gt; Newspaper stories and oral performance of text at the 
presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton &lt;/&gt;
&lt;LANGUAGE&gt; English &lt;/&gt;
&lt;RELATION TYPE = "CHILD"&gt; 
http://foo.bar/1993/presidential-address/collection.html &lt;/RELATION&gt;
&lt;RELATION TYPE = "ALTERNATE-FORM"&gt; 
http://foo.bar/1993/presidential-address/audio/06983921.au &lt;/RELATION&gt;
&lt;/CITATION&gt;
</pre><P>An obvious problem associated with this modification is that it
requires changes to both the HTML DTD as well as agreement in
principle of the "non-rendering" of the CITATION content in WWW
clients.</P>
<P>With respect to the non-rendering of data, consider the hypothetic
DATA element:</P>
<pre>
&lt;DATA NAME="Keywords" CONTENT="Information Retrieval"&gt;
</pre><P>This statement might encode that the phrase "Information
Retrieval" is associated with the DATA element "Keyword".
Note that the data is included as an attribute of the second value
defined for the DATA element.  Another possible HTML convention is
to enclose the data in tags: </P>
<pre>
&lt;DATA NAME="Keywords"&gt;Information Retrieval&lt;/DATA&gt;
</pre><p>If the browser encountered the second DATA statement, the phrase
"Information Retrieval" would display, but the display would be
suppressed if an HTML document contained the first DATA statement.
The situation for the CITATION element would be similar.  While
the bibliographic information in CITATION is potentially
useful for discovery and retrieval, the rendering or display in
browsers is somewhat problematic.</P>
<H4>5.3.2	Content-Negotiation</H4>
<P>Another possibility of incorporating this descriptive component
using the concepts of SGML's "marked sections" and HTTP's "content
negotiation" capabilities.  Marked sections in SGML show which parts
of a document are not processed or should only be processed under
certain conditions  <A HREF="#Herwijen">[Herwijen]</A>.
For example, parts of documents destined for different groups of
readers can be kept together in a single document. A parser can be
instructed to process the document for different groups and deliver
the only the appropriate parts.</P>
<P>HTTP's content negotiation is a way for browsers and servers to
"negotiate" for content  <A HREF="#Behlendorf">[Behlendorf]</A>.  The following is an simple example of this
type of negotiation:</P>
<pre><B>Client:</B> I'd like a copy of Maya Angelou's poem "On the Pulse of 
Morning" and any bibliographic information you may have in 
MARC or TEI formats.

<B>Server:</B> I do have this poem, however the only bibliographic 
information I have on this is encoded in the Dublin Core format.
</pre><P>in which the client could either automatically or interactively choose</P>
<pre><B>Client:</B>OK, give me both the poem and the bibliographic information
in Dublin Core.
</pre><P>or</P>
<pre><B>Client:</B>I can't handle that format of bibliographic information... 
Only give me the poem.
</pre><P>Content negotiation allows the browser to tell the server what
types of information it prefers or can easily handle, and the server
automatically provides it, in one step.  SGML marked sections and DTD
declarations could encapsulate this bibliographic information and
provide a way to include or exclude this information.  The following
is an example of this encapsulation of the CITATION in SGML:</P>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "HTTP://PURL.ORG/NET/DTD/HTML-DC.DTD"&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Transcription of Maya Angelou's "On the Pulse of Morning"&lt;/TITLE&gt;

&lt;![ &if-citation; [

&lt;CITATION&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;On the Pulse of Morning&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;AUTHOR SCHEME = "AACR2"&gt;Angelou, Maya&lt;/AUTHOR&gt;
&lt;PUBLISHER&gt;
University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center&lt;/PUBLISHER&gt;
&lt;OTHERAGENT TYPE="TRANSCRIBER"&gt;
University of Virginia Electronic Text Center&lt;/OTHERAGENT&gt;
...

]&gt;
</pre><P>The corresponding DTD for this citation 
located at "HTTP://PURL.ORG/NET/DTD/HTML-DC.DTD" would then specify:</P>
<pre>
&lt;!ENTITY % if-citation "INCLUDE"&gt;
</pre>
or
<pre>
&lt;!ENTITY % if-citation "IGNORE"&gt;
</pre><P>to include or omit the citation information.</P>
<P>Content-negotiation has been in HTTP since the
early days of the web.  It requires that both the server
and client support this protocol. Unfortunately, only a few HTTP
servers, such as the  <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>
and  <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/">W3O</A> server
currently support it. Few WWW clients use it correctly and fully.
 <A HREF="#Behlendorf">[Behlendorf]</A>.</P>
<H2>6.0	Conclusion</H2>
<P> Access to distributed networked information requires effective
mechanisms for resource discovery and retrieval.  With respect to the
rapid development of the World Wide Web and the electronic
dissemination of information, effective descriptive techniques become
increasingly important.  The META element, provide the basis for
document description, but does not provide the richness necessary for
complex descriptive schemes.  Providing descriptive capabilities of
metadata schemes as well as adding attribute information for more
accurate elemental description is one step towards a more accurate
document description and more effective discovery and retrieval. A
much more flexible environment is necessary to fully allow for richer
document description.  Future research in external declarations to
bibliographic information and the growing interest in HTTP content
negotiation look promising for this descriptive environment.</P>

elements are ambiguous due to the lack of element modifiers.  A more
useful record, for example, might identify the first RELATION element
as a "parent" and the second as a "sibling" of the object being
described.  Additionally, it would identify the type of access methods
for these objects, in this case in the form of URLs.  The TITLE
elements might be clarified: the first is a main title and the second
is a subtitle.  Since the HTML META element currently defined for HTML
2.0 severely constrains the richness of the description that can be
created, members of the HTML Working Group are discussing 
several proposals.</P>
<P>In the following, SCHEMEs and TYPEs are used to modify the META
element for a richer descriptive framework corresponding to the Dublin
Core element set.</P>

</pre><HR size=4><H2>Appendix 2.0: 	A Proposed Document Type Definition for the Dublin Metadata Core</H2>
<P>The following sample DTD is included to make the proposals in this
report more precise and to promote discussion among those wishing to
make improvements.  Since the SCHEME qualifier, as defined by the
participants in the Dublin Metadata Workshop, is potentially
ambiguous, the TYPE qualifier has also been defined.  SCHEME is used
when reference is made to an external authority for notation or
vocabulary. TYPE is used to describe a subclass of a generic element.
For example, the TITLE element has subclasses such as Subtitle, Main
Title, and Alternate Title.  The proposed distinction between SCHEME
and TYPE is a suggestion, and illustrates a problem
that will arise when the current version of the Dublin Core is
implemented and describes real data.  Much more discussion is
required before the problem of element modification can be adequately
resolved.  </P>
<P> The DTD in this appendix specifies one possible syntax for an SGML
version of the Dublin Core. It is for illustrative purposes only.
</P>
<pre>

&lt;!--
This is the ISO8879:1986 document type definition for the default
Dublin Core element set.  This DTD is subject to discussion and change
by the members of the library community, IETF's URI/URC working group,
or by anyone who cares to discuss this information.

This DTD results from the OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop,
Dublin, Ohio, March 3, 1995.  Additional information regarding this
workshop, attendees and a working group position paper are available
at &lt;URL:http://www.oclc.org:5046/conferences/metadata/metadata.html&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;!-- ============ Parameter Entities ===============

&lt;!-- Parameter entities for Elements
    These define the content models for the elements in the default
    set. The convention for those names is n.xxx, where xxx is the
    generic identifier of the element. --&gt;

&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Instance "(Author | Title | Subject | Identifier |
                    URN | Location | URL | Form | Publisher | Date |
                    ObjectType | OtherAgent | Relation | Source |
                    Language | Coverage)"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   % n.CITATION "(%n.Instance; | Instance)"&gt;

&lt;!-- CITATION is the element that contains all the others. Instance is an
  element that can group together any of the other elements, but not
  itself. --&gt;

&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Subject     "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Title       "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Author      "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.OtherAgent  "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Publisher   "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Date        "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Relation    "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.ObjectType  "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Form        "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Identifier  "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Source      "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Language    "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Coverage    "(Spatial | Temporal | #PCDATA)*" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Spatial     "(#PCDATA)" &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY   %  n.Temporal    "(#PCDATA)" &gt;

&lt;!-- Parameter entities for Attributes
    Almost all of the elements can have a "scheme" attribute that
    can be used to more precisely  indicate their semantics. The
    Many of the elements can have a "type" attribute as well in order
    to specify additional structure.

&lt;!-- Element list: Subject to change as this thing gets refined. Some
     elements for meta-metadata (version info on the URC itself)
     are the most likely candidates for addition. --&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Subject     - -     (%n.Subject;)
 -- The field of knowledge to which the resource belongs. The default
    content of the subject element is simple keywords. The scheme
    attribute can be used to indicate the use of a controlled
    vocabulary. -- &gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST Subject    Scheme   (%Subject.Scheme;)      #IMPLIED &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Identifier  - -     (%n.Identifier;)
 -- String or number used to uniquely identify this resource.
    Typically the URN element will be used in favor of the URN
    attribute on this element. Other identification schemes may
    also be used. -- &gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST Identifier Scheme   (%Identifier.Scheme;)   #IMPLIED &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Form        - -     (%n.Form;)
 -- The particular data representation of the resource. Typically
    this will be an Internet Media Type (formerly known as MIME

    dictionary, etc. -- &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   OtherAgent  - -     (%n.OtherAgent;)
 -- Other person(s) and/or organization(s) who have made a
    significant contribution to the resource. The value of this
    element should follow the guidelines for the AUTHOR element.

    Author and Publisher attributes of this element. -- &gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST OtherAgent Type     (%OtherAgent.Type;)     #IMPLIED
                        Scheme   (%OtherAgent.Scheme;)   #IMPLIED &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Relation    - -     (%n.Relation;)
 -- Relationship of this resource to another resource. This
    element should specify what the relationship is, as well as
    the target of the relationship. The TYPE attribute is used for
    this purpose, the SCHEME attribute indicates how the
    destination is encoded.  -- &gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST Relation   Type     (%Relationship.Type;)   #IMPLIED
                        Scheme   (%Relationship.Scheme;) #IMPLIED &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Source      - -     (%n.Source;)

    resource was derived. This is a special case of the RELATION
    element. -- &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Language    - -     (%n.Language;)
 -- The natural language(s) of the resource. When more than
    one Language element is specified, it indicates that more than
    one language is used to a significant degree in the work. No
    inference should be made about the relative proportions of the
    language content based on the order of appearence of the
    Language element. -- &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Coverage    - -     (%n.Coverage;)
 -- The spatial extent and/or temporal duration characteristic of
    the resource, e.g. "19'th Century France". -- &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Spatial     - -     (%n.Spatial;)
 -- For more precise indication of the spatial extent characteristic
    of the resource. -- &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT   Temporal    - -     (%n.Temporal;)
