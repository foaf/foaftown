This document summarizes a set of recommendations concerning the
representation of metadata, derived from discussion within the syntax
working group which met at the second Metadata Workshop, held at Warwick
University in April 1996.  The discussion begun in Warwick has been
continued electronically by the current authors, and this paper presents
both the recommendations agreed on by the syntax working group in
Warwick and some further developments for which the authors alone are
responsible.</p> 
<p> 
In brief, the syntax working group recommended:
<UL> 
<li>that recommendations be made showing how to use the HTML
<em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> element for Dublin-Core metadata (as described below in
section <a href="#MINIMAL">2.1 The minimal effort approach</a> and section 
<a href="#ARMSLENGTH">2.2 Keeping the metadata at arms-length</a>.</li> 
<li>that a standard canonical syntax be defined for Dublin-Core
metadata, using SGML syntax.  The working group defined no DTD, but
a possible DTD devised by the authors is given below in section
<a href="#DUB">3 The Dublin Core DTD fragment</a>.</li> 
</UL> 
<p>
Discussions in Warwick also led to an informal demonstration of how
SGML could be used as the mechanism for encoding the containers and
metadata packages foreseen in the Warwick Framework.  A sample DTD
for such packages is given in 
section <a href="#WAR">4 The Warwick Framework DTD fragment</a>.</p> 
<h1><a name="ID1">1 Requirements</a></h1><p> 
The following criteria were advanced as desirable features in
whatever syntax is to be used in defining a standard format for
metadata:</p>
<UL> 
<li>ability to express optional, repeatable, sequences </li> 
<li>verifiability, robustness</li> 
<li>compactness</li> 
<li>uniformity</li> 
<li>ability to express of qualifiers</li> 
<li>repeatability of groups </li> 
<li>machine processability and human comprehensibility </li> 
<li>internationalizability </li> 
<li>simplicity</li> 
<li>formality</li> 
</UL> 
<p> 
The following functional requirements were identified for the syntax:
</p>
<UL> 
<li>it should be simple enough for authors to create their own
metadata (either directly or via a suitable interface)</li> 
<li>it must be able to represent at least the elements
of the Dublin core</li> 
<li>it must support extension by users, with varying
degrees of formality and control, so that users can extend the
Dublin core</li> 
<li>it must be able to express attribute-value-scheme
triplets (since the metadata elements are all expressed as such)</li> 
<li>it must be able to express optionality and
repeatability</li> 
</UL>  
<p> 
The ability to carry out down-translation to the proposed scheme
from existing metadata schemes (specifically richer formats such as
MARC, TEI, IAFA templates) was assumed.
 </p> 
<p> 
There was no discussion of how the following additional requirements
might be achieved, though there was a general feeling that they were all
highly desirable:</p>
<UL> 
<li>mechanisms (such as a name registry) for constraining the
range of some or all possible attribute names and values</li> 
<li>mechanisms for grouping sub-parts of a specifications,
e.g. to express the object/instance distinction </li> 
<li>mechanisms for specifying the meaning of repeated
sub-parts of a specification, e.g. whether two <em>&lt;form&gt;</em> components
should be regarded as exclusive (copy in one of two forms)
or additive (copy in both forms).</li> 
</UL> 
 
<p> 
The problem of grouping, inheritance, and their meaning is discussed
further in a paper by C. M. Sperberg-McQueen,
"On Information Factoring in Dublin Metadata Records," 
which is accessible on the World-Wide Web at
<a href="http://www.uic.edu/~cmsmcq/tech/metadata.factoring.html">

<h1><a name="ID2">2 Summary of proposals</a></h1><p> 
This section presents the various possible approaches discussed at
the workshop, whether actively recommended by the syntax working
group or not.
A fuller treatment of some of them is also presented in a paper written
by Eric Miller following the first Metadata Workshop (see
<cite>Issues of Document Description in HTML</cite>, available
at <a href="http://www.oclc.org:5046/~emiller/publications/metadata/issues.html">
http://www.oclc.org:5046/~emiller/publications/metadata/issues.html</a>).</p> 
<h2><a name="MINIMAL">2.1 The minimal effort approach</a></h2><p> 
The syntax working group recommended that authors, publishers, and
site managers be encouraged to provide metadata in HTML documents by
means of HTML <em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> elements embedded in their documents.  More
elaborate metadata can be provided if the metadata records are external
to the HTML document, as described below, but for information providers
with limited ambitions, the method described here is recommended.
 </p> 
<p> 
The assumption here is that existing browsers and search engines
cannot be expected to accommodate any variation from current practice.
Any additional features must be transparent to existing software and
authoring practices.
 </p> 
<p> 
The <em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> element of HTML2 should be used, with
<em>name</em>and <em>content</em> attributes set to the
metadata element's name and value respectively.
 </p> 
<p> 
Example:
<pre> 
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;title>On the pulse of the morning&lt;/title>
&lt;meta name="title" content="On the pulse of the morning">
&lt;meta name="publisher content="University of Virginia Electronic Text Center">
&lt;meta name="otheragent:transcriber"
      content="University of Virginia Electronic Text Center">
&lt;meta name='date(ISO)' content="1993-01-23">
&lt;meta name="objectType" content="poem">
&lt;meta name="form" content="1 ASCII file">
&lt;meta name="form(IMT)" content="text/ASCII">
&lt;meta name="source"
      content="Newspaper stories and oral performance of text at the
       Presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton">
&lt;meta name="language(ISO 639)" content="en">
 ...
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;h1>On the pulse of the morning&lt;/h1>
 ...
</pre> 
 
<p> 
Advantages: No change is needed to existing browsers or search
engines. Any set of attribute-value pairs can be represented.
 </p> 
<p> 
Disadvantages: No constraint can be imposed on the semantics of the
attribute names used, and name clashes may occur. Other, possibly
inconsistent, conventions are already established for use of the
<em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> elements by other agents. This could however be overcome
by using a prefix such as "DC:", e.g.
<pre> 
&lt;meta name='DC:date(ISO)' content="1993-01-23">
</pre> 

<p> 
The order of <em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> elements within the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element
is not significant, and elements cannot be grouped, though a
sufficiently determined imagination might conceive of something like the
following:
<pre> 
&lt;meta name='DC:groupStart' content='group number 42'>
   &lt;meta name='DC:something' content="something else">
   &lt;!-- more metas here -->
&lt;meta name='DC:groupEnd' content= 'group number 42'>
</pre> 
<p> 
Miller's paper, referred to above, also suggests prefixing a group of
<em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> tags which together make up a metadata description of this
kind with a particular labelling <em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> tag such as
<pre> 
&lt;meta name='citation' content="Dublin Core">
</pre> 
<p> 
Without additional attributes such as <em>source</em> and
<em>type</em>, considerable `overloading' of
the attribute values is necessary to contain all the information
available in the Dublin core. Even in this trivial example, it has been
necessary to introduce some arbitrary syntax (the use of the colon and
parentheses) to distinguish parts of the <em>name</em> attribute.</p> 
<p> 
Furthermore, attribute values are limited in length by the value of
LITLEN (1024 according to the official SGML declaration for HTML2), or
by other arbitrary limits imposed by particular browsers.  A literal
cannot contain any tags which a browser might recognize, so another
syntax must be invented if subfields of Dublin core elements are
required.</p> 

 
<h2><a name="ARMSLENGTH">2.2 Keeping the metadata at arms-length</a></h2><p> 
For more complex metadata records, an unstructured series of
<em>&lt;meta&gt;</em> elements will not suffice; the syntax working group
recommended, therefore, that metadata consumers recognize references
to external metadata from within the HTML <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> element.</p> 
<p> 
This approach involves keeping the metadata in an distinct
document.  Because the metadata is independent of the form of the data
proper, free-standing metadata can document with equal facility
documents in HTML, ASCII, SGML, PDF, or proprietary formats, images,
sound files, maps, etc.  Clear endorsement of free-standing metadata,
and the construction of metadata catalogs, is thus important for
ensuring that metadata is usable for objects on the net which are not
also objects on WWW.
 </p> 
<p> 
Two variants of the encoding syntax for metadata were
discussed at the meeting: in the first, the metadata document uses
existing HTML elements. In the second it uses some other syntax better
suited to the requirements listed above. At the Warwick meeting, the
workgroup agreed that this syntax should be expressed using an SGML
DTD, and this is the approach which has been followed below. However,
there is no reason why some other syntax that meets the functional
requirements outlined above could not be
invented for this purpose.
 </p> 
<p> 
A one-way linkage in HTML documents, for example, is effected using
the <em>&lt;link&gt;</em> element:</p> 
<pre> 
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;link rel='metadata'
      href='pulse.meta'>
&lt;/head>
 ...
&lt;/html>
</pre> 
<p> 
Separating the metadata from the document makes it easy for existing
browsers and search engines to ignore it if they wish, while those which
are Dublin core-aware can access and process it effectively with no
additional cost. On the other hand, there may be significant additional
costs in ensuring that metadata and data are kept in step and
consistent.
 </p> 
<p> 
The next two sections discuss what exactly might be the contents of
the object referenced by <em>pulse.meta</em>.
 </p> 
<h3><a name="ID2.2.1">2.2.1 Mapping Dublin Core elements to HTML</a></h3><p> 
The attribute-value-class triples needed for the Dublin core can be
mapped on to any appropriate HTML element. At the meeting, the
<em>&lt;DL&gt;</em> element was suggested, as in the following example:
<pre> 
&lt;html>
&lt;head>&lt;title>Metadata for the Nice Pome&lt;/title>&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;dl>
&lt;dt>title&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>On the pulse of the morning&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>publisher&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>University of Virginia Electronic Text Center&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>otheragent:transcriber&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>University of Virginia Electronic Text Center&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>date:created/ISO&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>1993-01-23&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>objectType&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>poem&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>form&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>1 ASCII file&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>form/IMT&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>text/ASCII&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>source&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Newspaper stories and oral performance of text at the Presidential
inauguration of Bill Clinton&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>language/ISO 639&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>en&lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl>
&lt;/html>
</pre> 

<p> 
Advantages: Metadata is cleanly separated from the data. Problems
consequent on using attribute values to represent element content are no
longer a concern and more powerful structuring abilities (e.g. nesting,
repetition) are potentially available.
 </p> 
<p> 
Disadvantages: Almost anything can go into a metadata description.
(Unenforceable) conventions need to be established about how the
metadata descriptions are to be mapped to HTML elements.  It's not clear
how, for example, to do the SOURCE and TYPE attributes of the Dublin
Core without extending HTML2.
 </p> 
<p> 
This suggested approach did not gain much support from the syntax
working group and is not recommended.</p> 

 
<h3><a name="ID2.2.2">2.2.2 Using a Dublin-Core specific syntax</a></h3><p> 
The syntax working group recommended the preparation of an SGML DTD
for Dublin-Core metadata records; one such DTD is described below in
section <a href="#DUB">3 The Dublin Core DTD fragment</a>.
 </p> 
<p> 
The Dublin DTD defines specific elements for the 13 core elements,
each of which bears attributes for <em>type</em> and
<em>source</em>.
 </p> 
<p> 
Using this syntax, the above example might like look this:
 
<pre> 
&lt;!DOCTYPE dublinCore PUBLIC '-//OCLC//DTD Dublin core v.1//EN'>
&lt;dublinCore>
  &lt;title>On the Pulse of Morning&lt;/title>
  &lt;author>Maya Angelou&lt;/author>
  &lt;publisher>University of Virginia Electronic Text Center&lt;/publisher>
  &lt;otherAgent name='transcriber'>University of Virginia Electronic Text
   Center&lt;/otherAgent>
  &lt;date name='created' scheme='ISO'>1993-01-23&lt;/date>
  &lt;objectType>poem&lt;/objectType>
  &lt;form>1 ASCII file&lt;/form>
  &lt;form scheme='IMT'>text/ASCII&lt;/form>
  &lt;source>Newspaper stories and oral performance of text at the
    Presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton&lt;/source>
  &lt;language name='ISO 639'>en&lt;/language>
&lt;/dublinCore>
 
</pre> 

<p> 
Advantages: The syntax makes explicit the semantics of each Dublin
core element. Distinct attributes can be defined for scheme and type.
Element content could include other tags if subfields are required.
 </p> 
<p> 
Disadvantages: Only Dublin core elements are provided (but there is
an extension field). Discrete packages of metadata cannot be identified
and the semantics of repeated elements are not specified.</p> 

 

 
<h2><a name="ID2.3">2.3 The Warwick Framework DTD</a></h2><p> 
At the workshop, the authors suggested applying SGML not only to the
encoding of Dublin-Core records but also to the creation of metadata
<em>packages</em> and <em>containers</em>, as defined in the
architectural proposals for the Warwick Framework.  This section
summarizes the relevant points.
 </p> 
<p> 
The Warwick Framework DTD builds on the notion of discrete
<em>packages</em> of metadata elements discussed at the Warwick
Workshop. One such package might contain Dublin core elements; others
might contain specialised elements appropriate to other kinds of
metadata, or references to other components using other (possibly
non-SGML) notations.
 </p> 
<p> 
No specific package types additional to the Dublin core were
discussed in any detail; though it seems likely that other groups will
wish to define them. This can be done relatively easily by defining an
additional DTD fragment (along the lines of that discussed below).
Alternatively, new package types can also be created by using a generic
package type called a <em>&lt;package&gt;</em>, composed of typed
<em>&lt;metaData&gt;</em> or nestable <em>&lt;metaGroup&gt;</em> elements. This may be
easier to define (and avoids possible namespace clashes). Full details
of these are given below in section <a href="#WAR">4 The Warwick Framework DTD fragment</a>.
 </p> 
<p> 
This approach was explored in some detail by the authors in order to
demonstrate that the additional syntax and functionality required by
the `container' approach could be supported
directly by SGML, with no need to invent a new syntax and consequently
additional ad hoc software.
 </p> 
<p> 
A collection of packages of the same or different types  makes up a
<em>&lt;container&gt;</em> element. This could be linked  to from an HTML
document in the same way as in the preceding examples (using a
<em>&lt;link&gt;</em> element in the HTML document), or form a part of a
multipart MIME message along with the document itself. An example
might look like the following:
 
<pre> 
 
&lt;!DOCTYPE container PUBLIC '-//OCLC//DTD Warwick Framework Demo v.1//EN'>
&lt;container>
 
&lt;dublinCore>
  &lt;!-- etc. as in preceding example -->
&lt;/dublinCore>
 
&lt;package URI='hdl:oclc:repository/tc'
         name='OCLC Standard Terms and Conditions / Set FPC45'
         version='1.0'>
 &lt;metadata name='permit'>www.oclc.org
 &lt;metadata name='permit'>rsch.oclc.org
 &lt;metadata name='permit'>lou@vax.ox.ac.uk
 &lt;metadata name='deny'>dev.oclc.org
 &lt;metadata name='inquiries'>stu@oclc.org
&lt;/package>
 
&lt;/container>
</pre> 

<h1><a name="DUB">3 The Dublin Core DTD fragment</a></h1><p> 
This DTD fragment, prepared by the authors, is a slightly simplified
version of that proposed in the paper by Miller cited above. It defines
the following metadata elements, one for each of the components of the
Dublin Core, as defined at the first Metadata Workshop:
 
<DL> 
<dt>title</dt><dd>The name of the object, if it has one.</dd> 
<dt>author</dt><dd>Name of the persons and organizations primarily responsible for
the intellectual content of the resouce. Encode one name per
element.</dd> 
<dt>otherAgent</dt><dd>Other person(s) and/or organization(s) who have made a significant
contribution to the resource. The value of this element should follow
the guidelines for the <em>&lt;author&gt;</em> element.  The
<em>author</em> and <em>publisher</em> elements are
semantically equivalent to instances of this element with the values
"author" and "publisher" for their <em>type</em>
attributes respectively.</dd> 
<dt>publisher</dt><dd>The agent or agency responsible for making the resource
available. The value of this element should follow the
guidelines for the <em>&lt;author&gt;</em> element. </dd> 
<dt>date</dt><dd>The date of publication in any format (as indicated by the
<em>scheme</em> attribute).</dd> 
<dt>subject</dt><dd>The field of knowledge to which the resource belongs, typically
indicated as a series of keywords, possibly taken from a controlled
vocabulary as indicated by the <em>scheme</em> attribute.</dd> 
<dt>objectType</dt><dd>The abstract category of the resource, such as article, image,
dictionary, etc. </dd> 
<dt>form</dt><dd>The particular data representation of the resource. Typically
this will be an Internet Media Type (formerly known as MIME
content type). </dd> 
<dt>identifier</dt><dd>String or number used to uniquely identify this resource, for
example a URN, or identification number used by some other
scheme.</dd> 
<dt>relation</dt><dd>Relationship of this resource to another resource. This
element should specify what the relationship is (using the
<em>type</em> attribute)</dd> 
<dt>source</dt><dd>Objects, either electronic or printed, from which this
resource was derived. This is a special case of the <em>&lt;relation&gt;</em>
element.</dd> 
<dt>language</dt><dd>The natural language(s) of the resource. When more than one
<em>&lt;language&gt;</em> element is specified, it indicates that more than one
language is used to a significant degree in the work. No inference
should be made about the relative proportions of language content based
on the order of appearence of such elements.</dd> 
<dt>coverage</dt><dd>The spatial extent and/or temporal duration characteristic of the
resource, e.g. "19th Century France".</dd> 
</DL> 
<p> 
These elements all share the following attributes:
<DL> 
<dt>type</dt><dd>optionally identifies a subcategorization of the metadata</dd> 
<dt>scheme</dt><dd>identifies the domain or naming scheme from which categorizations
are taken</dd> 
</DL> 
<p> 
No closed set of values is defined for either of these attributes in
the present proposal, though some suggestive examples are to be found in
Miller's paper cited above.
 </p> 
<p> 
These elements and attributes are formally defined as follows:
<pre> 
&lt;!ENTITY % a.global '
          type               CDATA               #IMPLIED

&lt;!ELEMENT title         - O  (#PCDATA)                          >
&lt;!ATTLIST title              %a.global                          >
&lt;!ELEMENT author        - O  (#PCDATA)                          >
&lt;!ATTLIST author             %a.global                          >

The <em>&lt;metadata&gt;</em> element is described in more detail below, in
section <a href="#WAR">4 The Warwick Framework DTD fragment</a>.
<p> 
Any number of any of the above elements may be grouped together to
form a single Dublin core metadata description. Such a description is
contained by a single <em>&lt;dublinCore&gt;</em> element, which bears an
attribute <em>version</em> to indicate its version status.
 </p> 
<p> 
This element is formally defined as follows:
 
<pre> 
&lt;!ELEMENT dublinCore    - O  (title
                             | author
                             | otherAgent
                             | publisher
                             | date
                             | subject
                             | objectType
                             | form
                             | identifier
                             | relation
                             | source
                             | language
                             | coverage
                             | metadata)*                       >
&lt;!ATTLIST dublinCore
          version            CDATA               #IMPLIED       >
</pre> 

<p> 
Several alternative methods have been proposed for defining the
<em>scheme</em> and <em>type</em> attributes for various
elements, in order to combine the virtues of a controlled vocabulary
with the flexibility of an uncontrolled vocabulary:
<UL> 
<li>unrestricted values (as shown above), with suggested values
given in the written documentation</li> 
<li>values restricted to particular schemes and types, with
provision for simple modification of the DTD to enable other types
or schemes</li> 
<li>provision of both a <em>scheme</em> and an
<em>otherScheme</em> attribute, the first using controlled
vocabular, the second accepting unrestricted values</li> 
</UL> 
<p>
When this version of this document was prepared, no final
consensus had been reached.</p> 

 
<h1><a name="WAR">4 The Warwick Framework DTD fragment</a></h1><p> 
This DTD, prepared by the authors, is intended to support the
following three objectives:
<UL> 
<li>support for the Dublin core DTD as defined above</li> 
<li>support for structured generic metadata elements</li> 
<li>a framework within which these two can coexist</li> 
</UL> 

<h2><a name="ID4.1">4.1 Containers and packages</a></h2><p> 
A document conforming to this DTD is represented by a
<em>&lt;container&gt;</em> element. Each <em>&lt;container&gt;</em> element consists of
a sequence of one or more of the following package-level elements:
<DL> 
<dt>dublinCore</dt><dd>contains one or more of the metadata elements defined in the
Dublin core</dd> 
<dt>package</dt><dd>contains one or more generic metadata or metagroup elements</dd> 
<dt>packageRef</dt><dd>a reference to some other package</dd> 
</DL> 

<p> 
Other package-level elements may be defined at a later date: to
facilitate this, the contents of the <em>&lt;container&gt;</em> element are
defined indirectly using a parameter entity (see DTD below).
 </p> 
<p> 
Package-level elements all share the following attributes:
<DL> 
<dt>name</dt><dd>human-readable name for the element</dd> 
<dt>URI</dt><dd>Universal Resource Indicator (?) referencing the element</dd> 
<dt>version</dt><dd>version number or name</dd> 
</DL> 

<p> 
Of these attributes, <em>name</em>is required, while the other
two are optional. All three have CDATA content.
 </p> 
<p> 
These elements and attributes are formally defined as follows:
<pre> 
&lt;!ENTITY % packageType 'package | dublinCore | packageRef'      >
 
&lt;!ELEMENT container     - O  (%packageType)*                    >
&lt;!ELEMENT package       - O  (metadata | metaGroup |
                             %packageType)*                     >
&lt;!ATTLIST package
          name               CDATA               #REQUIRED
          URI                CDATA               #IMPLIED
          version            CDATA               #IMPLIED       >
&lt;!ELEMENT packageRef    - O  EMPTY                              >
&lt;!ATTLIST packageRef
          URI                CDATA               #IMPLIED
          name               CDATA               #REQUIRED
          version            CDATA               #IMPLIED       >
 
</pre> 

<p> 
Note that a <em>&lt;package&gt;</em> may also contain nested
<em>&lt;package&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;dublinCore&gt;</em> or <em>&lt;packageRef&gt;</em> elements.
This allows considerable flexibility in structuring metadata.</p> 

 
<h2><a name="ID4.2">4.2 Package components </a></h2><p> 
The components of the <em>&lt;dublinCore&gt;</em> element were defined above
in section <a href="#DUB">3 The Dublin Core DTD fragment</a>. The <em>&lt;package&gt;</em> element  may contain
a sequence of any number of the following sub-elements:
 
<DL> 
<dt>metadata</dt><dd>contains a single piece of metadata</dd> 
<dt>metaGroup></dt><dd>contains a group of <em>&lt;metadata&gt;</em> or nested <em>&lt;metaGroup&gt;</em>
elements</dd> 
</DL> 

<p> 
The above elements all share the following attributes:
<DL> 
<dt>type</dt><dd>categorizes the metadata or metagroup</dd> 
<dt>scheme</dt><dd>references the authority or taxonomy within which this piece of
metadata is defined</dd> 
<dt>show</dt><dd>indicates whether this metadata is visible (show), invisible
(noshow), or inherits visibility from its immediate parent element
(inherit).</dd> 
<dt>sortKey</dt><dd>optionally supplies a sort key or other normalized version of
this piece of metadata.</dd> 
<dt>index</dt><dd>indicates whether this metadata should be indexed (index),
not indexed (noindex), or should be treated in the same way as
its immediate parent element
(asparent).</dd> 
</DL> 

<p> 
These elements and attributes are formally defined as follows:
<pre> 
&lt;!ELEMENT metaGroup     - O  (#PCDATA | metadata | metaGroup)*  >
&lt;!ELEMENT metadata      - O  (#PCDATA | metadata)*              >
&lt;!ATTLIST metadata
          type               CDATA               #REQUIRED
          scheme             CDATA               'uncontrolled'
          show               (show
                             | noshow
                             | inherit)          inherit
          sortkey            CDATA               #IMPLIED
          index              (index
                             | noindex
                             | asparent)         asparent       >
