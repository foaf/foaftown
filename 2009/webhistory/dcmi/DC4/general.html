<hr>

This fourth workshop in the series will address major open issues
concerning deployment of the Dublin Core and afford developers and
planners an opportunity to share experiences with others.
<p>
Agenda items will include:

<UL>
  <LI> Extensibility Issues - The reason this is critical is to solidify the
DC as the Core on which others may build to satisfy their own
constraints.  Without it, other groups will find some key element
lacking, and will be compelled to start from scratch to reinvent the
wheel.
  <LI> Element Structure - Identification of default schemes and Subelement conventions.

  <LI> Element Refinement - Semantics and clearer definitions for certain of the elements
    (for example, coverage, relation, and rights management).   
</UL>

Other issues may be discussed, but the major focus will be on the above
crucial issues.
