<h1 align=center>Dublin Core Qualifiers/Substructure</h1>
<h3 align=center>Rebecca Guenther</h3>

<h3><strong>Introduction.</strong></h3><br>The following proposes
a core set of qualifiers for the Dublin Core element set.  It
attempts to find a middle ground between the "minimalists" (those
wanting a minimum of DC qualifiers and substructure if any) and
the "structuralists" (those wanting more precision in refinement
of the elements for searching).  
<p>
The document has been updated as a result of discussions at DC5 in Helsinki in October 1997.  It
may be replaced in the near future by the report of the DC5 Subelement Working Group, which
discussed the type qualifier.  This document also includes information on the scheme qualifier.  The
concept of a registry was discussed at DC4, which would need to be established and would maintain
any qualifier list.  
<p>
This document deals only with the qualifiers "scheme" and "type". 
A scheme qualifier is used to interpret the value in the content
and is generally based on external standards.  A type qualifier
refines the definition of the data element itself.  
<p>
Two principles were agreed upon at the DC4 meeting in Canberra
relating to the type qualifier (also known as Dublin Core subelement):
<ul>
<li>that it may be used only to refine the element, not to extend
its semantics<br>
<li>that if the element list is used without qualifiers, the
content can still be understood. Thus, each element shall have a
default meaning.</ul>
<p>
If a Dublin Core subelement does not meet these principles, then an
extensibility mechanism may be used (i.e., indicate the
extensible element set from which the qualifier came).  In this
case the metadata would not be regarded as falling within the
Dublin Core list of elements.
<p>
Further principles for subelements were established at DC5, which will be reported in the Subelement
Working Group report.  There was little discussion about scheme qualifiers, so that information in
this document is preliminary.
<p>
Following is a list of qualifiers ("core qualifiers") which
is an intermediate approach between the minimalist approach
of using no or few qualifiers and the more complex approach in<a
href="http://www.roads.lut.ac.uk/Metadata/DC-SubElements.html">
Dublin Core Qualifiers</a> by Jon Knight and Martin Hamilton.  The
latter document has been heavily used, but the number of
qualifiers is considerably lessened here.
<p>
Definitions are taken from the Weibel/Kunze/Lagoze RFC <a
href="http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements">Dublin Core Metadata
Element Set:
Reference Description</a> (as updated 2 October 1997).  All qualifiers are optional.  The default
for "scheme" is
nothing (it is not controlled by any standard).  The default
for "type" is the definition of the element iteself.  If the default is used, no
qualifier is given.
<p>
<h3><strong>Proposed Dublin Core Qualifiers/Subelements</strong></h3><br>
<strong>1. Title</strong><br>
     The name given to the resource by the CREATOR or PUBLISHER.
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>: not necessary<br>
<p>
<em>TYPE</em>:<ul><li>DC.Title (unqualified)<br>
           <li>DC.Title.Alternative (used for any titles other
           than the main title including subtitle, etc.)</ul><br>
<p>
<strong>2. Author or Creator</strong><br>
     The person(s) or organization(s) primarily responsible for
     the intellectual content of the resource.  For example,
     authors in the case of written documents, artists,
     photographers, or illustrators in the case of visual
     resources.
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li>LCNAF (Library of Congress Name Authority
File)</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>:<ul><li>DC.Creator (unqualified)<br>
<li>DC.Creator.PersonalName<br>
<li>DC.Creator.CorporateName (includes conference name)<br>
<li>DC.Creator.PersonalName.Address (includes any type of address, email or otherwise)<br>
<li>DC.Creator.CorporateName.Address<br></ul>
Note that qualifiers listed in the Knight/Hamilton document
extend the element rather than refine it (e.g., postal, phone,
fax, affiliation, etc.).  Only address is included here because it
has been used frequently in current metadata projects.  Email may
be considered an alternative way of specifying the author. 
If other qualifiers are needed (e.g. affiliation), they should be used as local extensions.
<p>
<strong>3. Subject and Keywords</strong><br>
The topic of the resource. Typically, subject will be expressed as keywords or phrases
that describe the subject or content of the resource. The use of controlled vocabularies
and formal classification schemas is encouraged.<br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li> (Unqualified: Keyword is default)<br>
<li>LCSH (Library of Congress Subject Headings)<br>
<li> MeSH (Medical Subject Headings<br>
<li> AAT (Art and Architechture Thesaurus)<br>
<li>LCNAF (Library of Congress Name Authority File): for names used as subjects<br>
<li> DDC (Dewey Decimal Classification)<br>
<li> LCC (Library of Congress Classification)<br>
<li>NLM (National Library of Medicine Classification)<br>
<li>UDC (Universal Decimal Classification</ul><br>
The above are the most frequently used.  The scheme could point
to the controlled list maintained by the Library of Congress in
the <a href="gopher://marvel.loc.gov/00/.listarch/usmarc/relators.txt">USMARC
Code List for Relators, Sources, Description Conventions</a>, which includes many others (Part
III: Classification Sources
and Part IV: Subject/Index Term Sources; these documents are currently under
revision for a new edition).  Many locally defined thesauri or classification schemes are
possible.<br>
<br>
<em>TYPE</em>: not necessary<br>
<p>
<strong>4. Description</strong><br>
     A textual description of the content of the resource,
     including abstracts in the case of document-like objects or
     content descriptions in the case of visual resources. <br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>: <ul><li>(Abstract is default)<br>
<li>URL</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>: not necessary <br>
<p>
<strong>5. Publisher</strong><br>
The entity responsible for making the resource available in its present form, such as a
 publishing house, a university department, or a corporate entity.<br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>: not necessary<br>
<em>TYPE</em>:  <ul><li>DC.Publisher (unqualified)<br>
<li>DC.Publisher.PersonalName<br>
<li> DC.Publisher.CorporateName<br>
<li>DC.Publisher.PersonalName.Address
<li>DC.Publisher.CorporateName.Address</ul><br>
<p>
<strong>6. Other Contributor </strong><br>
A person or organization not specified in a <em>creator</em> element who has made
  significant intellectual contributions to the resource but whose contribution is secondary
  to any person or organization specified in a <em>creator</em> element (for example,
  editor, transcriber, and illustrator).<br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li>LCNAF (Library of Congress Name Authority
File)</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>:<ul><li>DC.Contributor (unqualified)<br>
<li> DC.Contributor.PersonalName<br>
<li> DC.Contributor.CorporateName<br>
<li>DC.Contributor.PersonalName.Address
<li>DC.Contributor.CorporateName.Address</ul><br>
At DC4 it was decided that role was not needed. It has thus not been
included here. If needed, it could be included as a local extension. (At the Library of Congress, we
have found that names are all searched in the same index and there is
no need to further specify role in the work. We ceased to
indicate this in bibliographic records a long time ago.)
<p>
<strong>7. Date</strong><br>
Date associated with the creation or availability of the resource.<br>
NOTE that this definition was changed at DC5.  The date can be a single date or a range of
dates.<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li> (Default is ISO 8601)<br>
<li>ANSI X3.30<br> 
<li>IETF RFC 822<br>
<li>(Others?)</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>:  Note that the names of the subelements have not been agreed upon.  The
Date Working Group continues to work on these.  There was some controversy at the end of DC5 as
to whether the first two type subelements should be combined.  It was also uncertain whether to
include the last three subelements.<br>
<ul><li>DC.Date.Creation_of_intellectual_content<br>
<li>DC.Date.Creation/Modification_of_present_form<br>
<li>DC.Date.Formal_publication<br>
<li>DC.Date.Available<br>
<li>DC.Date.Valid (includes verification)<br>
<li>DC.Date.Acquisition/Accession<br>
<li>DC.Date.Accepted<br>
<li>DC.Date.DataGathering</ul><br>
<p>
<strong>8. Resource Type </strong><br>
The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working paper, technical
  report, essay, dictionary. For the sake of interoperability, <em>type</em> should be
  selected from an enumerated list that is under development in the workshop series at the
  time of publication of this document. See <a  
href="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Metadata/types.html">http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Metadata/types.h
tml </a>for current thinking on the application of this element.<br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>: not necessary, but an enumerated list of types is.<br>
<p>
<strong>9. Format  </strong><br>
The data format of the resource, used to identify the software and possibly hardware
  that might be needed to display or operate the resource. For the sake of interoperability,
  <em>format</em> should be selected from an enumerated list that is under development in
  the workshop series at the time of publication of this document. <br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li>IMT (i.e. MIME)<br>
<li>DCPMT (Dublin Core Physical Medium Type) This is a new concept discussed by the
Subelement Working Group at DC5.  It would be an enumerated list of types of
physical media when an IMT is inappropriate (e.g. a nonelectronic resource)
</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>: not necessary
<p>
<strong>10. Resource Identifier </strong><br>
String or number used to uniquely identify the resource. Examples for networked
  resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other globally-unique identifiers,such
  as International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names would also be
  candidates for this element in the case of off-line resources. <br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li> (URL is default)<br>
<li>URN (Uniform Resource Name)<br>
<li>ISBN (International Standard Book Number)<br>
<li>ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)<br>
<li>SICI (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier) <br>
<li>FPI (Formal Public Identifier)</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>: Not necessary<br>
<p>
<strong>11. Source</strong><br>
A string or number used to uniquely identify the work from which this resource was
  derived, if applicable. For example, a PDF version of a novel might have a <em>source</em>
  element containing an ISBN number for the physical book from which the PDF version was
  derived. <br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li>(Free text is default)<br>
<li>URL<br>
<li>URN<br>
<li>ISBN<br>
<li>ISSN</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>: not necessary<br>
<p>
<strong>12. Language </strong><br>
     Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource. 
     Where practical, the content of this field should coincide
     with RFC 1766. See: <a
  href="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt">http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt</a><br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li>IETF RFC 1766<br>
<li>Z39.53<br>
<li>ISO 639-1<br>
<li>ISO 639-2/B (after final publication)</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>: Not necessary<br>
Note that the current ISO 639 (to become ISO 639-1 when ISO 639-2
3-character code is approved), which is used in RFC 1766, covers only about 140 languages as
compared with the newly developed standard ISO 639-2, which includes about
400 languages.  (For instance, ISO 639-1 does not distinguish
ancient languages from modern languages.)  Many agencies will
need the larger more extensive list that ISO 639-2 provides. 
ISO 639-2 was approved in 1997; approval of the Final Draft International Standard is forthcoming
followed by publication by ISO.  Note that ISO 639-2 includes a bibliographic set (ISO 639-2/B) and
a terminologic set (ISO 639-2/T); the bibliographic set is preferred for metadata because of its
widespread use in bibliographic agencies.  The new standard is closer to Z39.53 than to ISO 639-1.
<p>
<strong>13. Relation</strong><br>
     Relationship to other resources.  The intent of specifying
     this element is to provide a means to express relationships
     among resources that have formal relationships to others,
     but exist as discrete resources themselves.  For example,
     images in a document, chapters in a book, or items in a
     collection.  A formal specification of RELATION is currently
     under development.  Users and developers should understand
     that use of this element should be currently considered
     experimental.<br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li>(Default is free text)<br>
<li>URL<br>
<li>URN<br>
<li>ISBN</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>:  This element is considered to be developing rapidly within the context of
collection-level descriptions.  Subelements may be defined at a later date.  The following Relation
categories were enumerated at DC5; these should not be considered formal subelement names:<br>
<ul><li>Creative (e.g. translation, annotation)<br>
<li>Mechanical (copy, format change, mirror copy)<br>
<li>Version (edition, draft)<br>
<li>Inclusion (collection, part)<br>
<li>Reference (citation)</ul><br>
<p>
<strong>14. Coverage</strong><br>
The spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the resource. Formal specification 
of <em>coverage</em> is currently under development. Users and developers should understand
that use of this element is currently considered to be experimental. <br>
<p>
<em>SCHEME</em>:  To be determined by Coverage Working Group<br>
<em>TYPE</em>: The following were determined by the Coverage Working Group.  More
information is in <a
href="http://www.sdc.ucsb.edu/~mary/coverage.htm">http://www.sdc.ucsb.edu/~mary/coverage.
htm </a> <br>
<ul><li>DC.Coverage.PeriodName<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.PlaceName<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.t<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.x<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.y<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.z<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.Polygon<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.Line<br>
<li>DC.Coverage.3d</ul><br>
<p>
<strong>15. Rights Management</strong><br>
A link to a copyright notice, to a rights-management statement, or to a service that
 would provide information about terms of access to the resource. Formal specification of
<em>rights</em>
  is currently under development. Users and developers should understand that use of this
  element is currently considered to be experimental.<br>
<em>SCHEME</em>:<ul><li>(Default is free text)<br>
<li>URL<br>
<li>URN</ul><br>
<em>TYPE</em>: Not necessary; subelements are implementation specific.
