<P>
Following on from the <A href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/DC4/">4<sup>th</sup> Dublin Core
Metadata Workshop</a> in Canberra on 3-5 March 1997, the National Library
of Australia organised a Seminar on International Metadata
Developments on 6 March. A <a href="./meta/report.html">Report</a> has been prepared which summarises the Seminar and provides access to some of the papers presented.</P>
<P>
The Seminar drew on the wide range of <a href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/cgi-bin/DC4/registered.pl.cgi">international speakers</a>
attending the 4th Dublin Core Workshop and provided a first
hand opportunity to understand the wide range of international
developments in metadata standards and to discuss possible ways
of implementing standard metadata elements by Australian creators
of electronic publications. </P>
<P>
Metadata provides a consistent way of describing Internet information
which improves the reliability and efficiency of searching. This
Seminar provided a good overview of the latest developments
and standards that are being designed to improve the accessibility
to electronic information. </P>
