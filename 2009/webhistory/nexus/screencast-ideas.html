screencast-ideas -- DanBri</TITLE><NEXTID N="z1"></HEAD><BR>At the CERN
celebration for the Web's 20th year,
we got a nice demo of this code running on the original NeXT cube....
including the development environment that made the whole thing possible.
It would be nice to make that video available if the on-screen footage is
visible,
but also to go through the UI and document it in a more detailed fashion via
video screen capture.
How hard can it be? :)<P>this is a note,
