WWW</A> browser-editor<P>I have never used it before.
Some thoughts on what might be interesting:<P>- make a screencast,
showing off basic functionality in a youtube-accessible manner<BR>-
reconstruct the UI pieces in a modern OSX setting,
so iphone and osx developers can undestand how the Web got made<BR>- make a
wiki (since most browsers still aren't also editors) and collect ideas for
student projects around the notion that early Web browsers are cultural
heritage treasures,
whose memory should be kept alive as the Web grows...<BR>- suggestions to me
