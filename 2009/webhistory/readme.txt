What is this?

An *edited* copy of the www-talk archives from 1991 (Oct-Dec 1991)

I have tried to make the material more readable, initially by regularising the 
text formatting, removing some un-interesting headers, and getting it ready to 
try to make an HTML version.

Since the list describes the creation of HTML, automatically HTML-izing it might be 
tricky.

The intent here is to be respectful of what people originally said (I'm not fixing typos
or editing textual content), but make it more readable than the original plain text dumps. 

In plain text form, this is hard to read due to fixed width issues. I'm not yet sure
how best to convert to html ... by hand or with some tool or scripting...

Current main online versions of this material are

http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/

OK ... update ... i ran txt2html over my slightly-tidied text, to give:
