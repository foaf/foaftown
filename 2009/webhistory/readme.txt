What is this?

An *edited* copy of the www-talk archives from 1991 (Oct-Dec 1991)

I have tried to make the material more readable, initially by regularising the 
text formatting, removing some un-interesting headers, and getting it ready to 
try to make an HTML version.

Since the list describes the creation of HTML, automatically HTML-izing it might be 
tricky.

The intent here is to be respectful of what people originally said (I'm not fixing typos
or editing textual content), but make it more readable than the original plain text dumps.
