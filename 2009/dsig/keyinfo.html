<h1 style="clear: both">KeyInfo vocabulary</h1>

<p>
This RDF vocabulary provides terminology for describing key
information, based on structures from XML Signature.
</p>
<p>
It defines classes and properties that correspond to a subset of the
xmlsig-core RDF datamodel that was sketched as part of the W3C XML Digital Signature recommendation (2000, 2nd edition 200x).
</p>
<p>
We are concerned here purely with the 'key info' construct, and with
reflecting into an RDF vocabulary just enough of the XML Signature
concepts that we can associate X509 and PGP key data with other claims
about the parties (whether personal, organizational, or something else)
that hold them. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please note that this work is <em>purely
speculative. Do not use it for anything beyond research
activities. Feedback is welcomed via foaf-protocols@lists.foaf-project.org
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The core concept here is 'KeyInfo'. XML Signature captures this in an
XML element, and the suggested RDF representation included in the spec
models this as a relationship between a "Signature" object and another
object of un-named type. As we are only representing KeyInfo, rather
than attempting a full expression of xmlsig in RDF, we will begin with
an RDF class, "KeyInfo", and then pick up the suggested properties for
this class directly from the xmlsig design.
</p>

<p>
The XML Signature diagram includes the following key:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>(...) - anonymous node</li>
  <li>blue - xml keyword</li>
  <li>Element Attribute = - implicit element content</li>
  <li>element/attribute - "literal"</li>
  </ul>

<p>
This is not entirely clear. The diagram also contains indicative
  instance data, which helps give some sense of the intended
  design. These examples are elaborated upon here, for similar
  reason.</p>

<h2>Open Issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How much RDFS/OWL do we need to capture things more
  explicitly?</li>
  <li>How do we say that a property can point to an XML element?</li>
  <li>What additional considerations does an RDF environment bring?
  (eg. partial information, extensions, use of URIs/IRIs, whitespace
  handling; syntax-layer issues eg. GRDDL, N3, RDF/XML, RDFa, SPARQL,
  RIF)</li>
  <li>Do we say anything about classes where URIs are expected vs
  bnodes? security/privacy aspects of parties identifying others by http
  URI? (HTTP logs etc. re privacy, plus usual http insecurities)</li>
</ul>
