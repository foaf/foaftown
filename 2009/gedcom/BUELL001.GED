2 CONT Davison (1541?-1608), and after 1590 he was bailiff and postmaster in 
2 CONT Scrooby. There he organized a group of religious dissenters, often called 
2 CONT the Pilgrims, who in 1606 separated from the Church of England. Two years 
2 CONT later Brewster and some Pilgrims, to avoid persecution, moved to the 
2 CONT Netherlands, settling in Leiden. He was the ruling elder of the sect, and 
2 CONT he supported himself by teaching and by publishing religious books that 
2 CONT had been banned by the English government. With another Pilgrim leader, 
2 CONT William Bradford, he returned to England in 1619 and secured a patent from 
2 CONT the Virginia Company for a tract of land in America. Brewster remained in 
2 CONT England until September 16, 1620, when he boarded the Mayflower for the 
2 CONT trip to America. He was a signer of the Mayflower Compact and of the 
2 CONT constitution of Plymouth Colony, and he continued as a leader of the 
2 CONT colony. Until 1629, when an ordained minister was appointed, Brewster was 
2 CONT the only church officer at the Plymouth Colony.

1 NOTE He was also duke of Normandy, and first monarch of the house of Anjou, or 
2 CONT Plantagenet, an important administrative reformer, who was one of the most 
2 CONT powerful European rulers of his time. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Henry became duke of Normandy in 1151. The following year, on the death of 
2 CONT his father, he inherited the Angevin territories in France. By his 
2 CONT marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry added vast territories in 
2 CONT southwestern France to his possessions. Henry claimed the English kingship 
2 CONT through his mother.  She had been designated the heiress of Henry I but 
2 CONT had been deprived of the succession by her cousin, Stephen of Blois, who 
2 CONT made himself king. In 1153 Henry defeated Stephen's armies in England and 
2 CONT compelled the king to choose him as his successor; on Stephen's death, the 
2 CONT following year, Henry became king. During the first few years of his reign 
2 CONT Henry quelled the disorders that had developed during Stephen's reign, 
2 CONT regained the northern counties of England, which had previously been ceded 
2 CONT to Scotland, and conquered North Wales. In 1171-72 he began the Norman 
2 CONT conquest of Ireland and in 1174 forced William the Lion, king of the 
2 CONT Scots, to recognize him as overlord. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1164 Henry became involved in a quarrel with Thomas à Becket, whom he 
2 CONT had appointed archbishop of Canterbury. By the Constitutions of Clarendon, 
2 CONT the king decreed that priests accused of crimes should be tried in royal 
2 CONT courts; Becket claimed that such cases should be handled by ecclesiastical 
2 CONT courts, and the controversy that followed ended in 1170 with Becket's 
2 CONT murder by four of Henry's knights. Widespread indignation over the murder 
2 CONT forced the king to rescind his decree and recognize Becket as a martyr. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although he failed to subject the church to his courts, Henry's judicial 
2 CONT reforms were of lasting significance. In England he established a 
2 CONT centralized system of justice accessible to all freemen and administered 
2 CONT by judges who traveled around the country at regular intervals. He also 
2 CONT began the process of replacing the old trial by ordeal with modern court 
2 CONT procedures. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT From the beginning of his reign, Henry was involved in conflict with Louis 
2 CONT VII, king of France, and later with Louis's successor, Philip II, over the 
2 CONT French provinces that Henry claimed. A succession of rebellions against 
2 CONT Henry, headed by his sons and furthered by Philip II and by Eleanor of 
2 CONT Aquitaine, began in 1173 and continued until his death. Henry was 
2 CONT succeeded by his son Richard I, called Richard the Lion-Hearted.

1 NOTE She inherited the duchy of Aquitaine from her father in 1137, the same 
2 CONT year in which she was married to Louis VII of France. She accompanied her 
2 CONT husband on the Second Crusade to the Holy Land, where it was rumored that 
2 CONT she committed adultery. The scandal, and the fact that she had not given 
2 CONT the king a male heir, resulted in an annulment of their marriage in 1152 
2 CONT under the pretext of blood kinship between her and the king. Later that 
2 CONT year, Eleanor married and gave her possessions to Henry Plantagenet, count 
2 CONT of Anjou, who in 1154 became Henry II, king of England. In 1170, the queen 
2 CONT induced her husband to invest their son Richard the Lion-Hearted with her 
2 CONT personal dominions of Gascony, Aquitaine, and Poitou. When Richard and his 
2 CONT brothers rebelled against their father in 1173, Eleanor, already alienated 
2 CONT from the king because of his unfaithfulness, supported her sons. 
2 CONT Consequently, she was placed in confinement until 1185. After her release, 
2 CONT she secured the succession of her son Richard, who had become heir 
2 CONT apparent at the death in 1183 of his eldest brother. From the death of 
2 CONT King Henry II in 1189 until Richard's return from the Third Crusade in 
2 CONT 1194, Eleanor ruled as regent. During this time, she foiled the attempt of 
2 CONT her son John in 1193 to conspire with France against the new king. After 
2 CONT the return of Richard, she arranged a reconciliation between the two 
2 CONT brothers. Eleanor continued to be prominent in public affairs until she 
2 CONT retired to the abbey in Fontevrault, France, where she died on April 1, 
2 CONT 1204.

1 NOTE He was also duke of Aquitaine and count of Poitou.  When he was an infant, 
2 CONT Richard was betrothed to a daughter of the French king Louis VII, and in 
2 CONT 1172 he was given the duchy of Aquitaine in France, his mother's 
2 CONT inheritance. His early years were spent in warring against his father to 
2 CONT protect his own interests; he emerged a brilliant soldier. In 1189 he 
2 CONT became king of England and shortly thereafter set out on the Third 
2 CONT Crusade. He was accompanied by the young Philip II, king of France, son of 
2 CONT Louis VII. The Crusade proved a failure almost from the start, mainly 
2 CONT because of the lack of harmony between the two kings. In Sicily Richard 
2 CONT quarreled with Philip and refused to marry Philip's sister as planned. 
2 CONT Instead he married Berengaria of Navarre on Cyprus, which he conquered in 
2 CONT 1191. After capturing Acre from the Saracens that same year, Richard 
2 CONT executed 2700 Muslim prisoners of war. It was Richard's personal valor in 
2 CONT the Holy Land, however, rather than his ruthlessness, that made his name 
2 CONT famous in legend. Conflict over policy in the Holy Land resulted in a 
2 CONT break between the two, and Philip returned to France alone. Richard spent 
2 CONT months in indecisive contests against Saladin, sultan of Egypt and Syria, 
2 CONT before making a truce by which Jerusalem was left in Saladin's hands. 
2 CONT Captured en route to England by Leopold V, duke of Austria (1157-94), 
2 CONT Richard was handed over to Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV. He was released in 
2 CONT 1194 only after paying a heavy ransom. Richard returned to England and 
2 CONT there made peace with his brother, John, later king of England, who in his 
2 CONT absence had been conspiring with Philip to usurp the English throne. 
2 CONT Leaving the government of England to the care of the able administrator 
2 CONT Hubert Walter, archbishop of Canterbury (died 1205), Richard went to 
2 CONT France in 1194 to wage war against the French king. Campaigns in defense 
2 CONT of his European lands continued for five years. Victor in most of the 
2 CONT warfare in which he engaged, Richard was fatally wounded by an arrow 
2 CONT during an insignificant skirmish in 1199. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT As king, Richard had chosen able ministers, to whom he left most matters 
2 CONT of administration. Under his rule, however, England suffered heavy 
2 CONT taxation, levied to support his expeditions. Sometimes cruel, sometimes 
2 CONT magnanimous, and always courageous, Richard was well versed in the 
2 CONT knightly accomplishments of his age and was also a poet. He was to become 
2 CONT the hero of many legendary tales.

2 CONT father, who died in 1087, left him no land, Henry made several 
2 CONT unsuccessful attempts to gain territories on the Continent. On the death 
2 CONT of his brother William II in 1100, Henry took advantage of the absence of 
2 CONT another brother Robert, who had a prior claim to the throne to seize the 
2 CONT royal treasury and have himself crowned king at Westminster. Henry 
2 CONT subsequently secured his position with the nobles and with the church by 
2 CONT issuing a charter of liberties that acknowledged the feudal rights of the 
2 CONT nobles and the rights of the church. In 1101 Robert, who was duke of 
2 CONT Normandy, invaded England, but Henry persuaded him to withdraw by 
2 CONT promising him a pension and military aid on the Continent. In 1102 Henry 
2 CONT put down a revolt of nobles, who subsequently took refuge in Normandy, 
2 CONT where they were aided by Robert. By defeating Robert at Tinchebray, 
2 CONT France, in 1106, Henry won Normandy. During the rest of his reign, 
2 CONT however, he constantly had to put down uprisings that threatened his rule 
2 CONT in Normandy. The conflict between Henry and Anselm, archbishop of 
2 CONT Canterbury, over the question of lay investiture (the appointment of 
2 CONT church officials by the king), was settled in 1107 by a compromise that 
2 CONT left the king with substantial control in the matter. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Because he had no surviving male heir, Henry was forced to designate his 
2 CONT daughter Matilda as his heiress. After his death Henry's nephew, Stephen 
2 CONT of Blois, usurped the throne, plunging the country into a protracted civil 
2 CONT war that ended only with the accession of Matilda's son, Henry II, in 
2 CONT 1154.  He also had a child who died young.  He was called "the Lion of 
2 CONT Justice".

1 NOTE He was the first Norman king of England, also duke of Normandy, who has 
2 CONT been called one of the first modern kings and is generally regarded as one 
2 CONT of the outstanding figures in western European history. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT William was an illegitimate son and is therefore sometimes called William 
2 CONT the Bastard. Upon the death of his father, the Norman nobles, honoring 
2 CONT their promise to Robert, accepted William as his successor. Rebellion 
2 CONT against the young duke broke out almost immediately, however, and his 
2 CONT position did not become secure until 1047 when, with the aid of Henry I, 
2 CONT king of France, he won a decisive victory over a rebel force near Caen. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During a visit in 1051 to his childless cousin, Edward the Confessor, king 
2 CONT of England, William is said to have obtained Edward's agreement that he 
2 CONT should succeed to the English throne. In 1053, defying a papal ban, 
2 CONT William married a descendant of King Alfred the Great, thereby 
2 CONT strengthening his claim to the crown of England. Henry I, fearing the 
2 CONT strong bond between Normandy and Flanders resulting from the marriage, 
2 CONT attempted in 1054 and again in 1058 to crush the powerful duke, but on 
2 CONT both occasions William defeated the French king's forces. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Conquest of England
2 CONT 
2 CONT About 1064, the powerful English noble, Harold, earl of Wessex, was 
2 CONT shipwrecked on the Norman coast and taken prisoner by William. He secured 
2 CONT his release by swearing to support William's claim to the English throne. 
2 CONT When King Edward died, however, the witenagemot (royal council) elected 
2 CONT Harold king. Determined to make good his claim, William secured the 
2 CONT sanction of Pope Alexander II (died 1073) for a Norman invasion of 
2 CONT England. The duke and his army landed at Pevensey on September 28, 1066. 
2 CONT On October 14, the Normans defeated the English forces at the celebrated 
2 CONT Battle of Hastings, in which Harold was slain. William then proceeded to 
2 CONT London, crushing the resistance he encountered on the way. On Christmas 
2 CONT Day he was crowned king of England in Westminster Abbey. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The English did not accept foreign rule without a struggle. William met 
2 CONT the opposition, which was particularly violent in the north and west, with 
2 CONT strong measures; he was responsible for the devastation of great areas of 
2 CONT the country, particularly in Yorkshire, where Danish forces had arrived to 
2 CONT aid the Saxon rebels. By 1070 the Norman conquest of England was complete. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT William invaded Scotland in 1072 and forced the Scottish king Malcolm III 
2 CONT MacDuncan (died 1093) to pay him homage. During the succeeding years the 
2 CONT Conqueror crushed insurrections among his Norman followers, including that 
2 CONT incited in 1075 by Ralph de Guader, 1st earl of Norfolk, and Roger 
2 CONT Fitzwilliam, earl of Hereford, and a series of uprisings in Normandy led 
2 CONT by his eldest son Robert, who later became Robert II, duke of Normandy. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT His Achievements
2 CONT 
2 CONT One feature of William's reign as king was his reorganization of the 
2 CONT English feudal and administrative systems. He dissolved the great 
2 CONT earldoms, which had enjoyed virtual independence under his Anglo-Saxon 
2 CONT predecessors, and distributed the lands confiscated from the English to 
2 CONT his trusted Norman followers. He introduced the Continental system of 
2 CONT feudalism; by the Oath of Salisbury of 1086 all landlords swore allegiance 
2 CONT to William, thus establishing the precedent that a vassal's loyalty to the 
2 CONT king overrode his fealty to his immediate lord. The feudal lords were 
2 CONT compelled to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the local courts, which 
2 CONT William retained along with many other Anglo-Saxon institutions. The 
2 CONT ecclesiastical and secular courts were separated, and the power of the 
2 CONT papacy in English affairs was greatly curtailed. Another outstanding 
2 CONT accomplishment was the economic survey undertaken and incorporated in the 
2 CONT Domesday Book in 1086. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1087, during a campaign against King Philip I of France, William burned 
2 CONT the town of Mantes (now Mantes-la-Jolie). William's horse fell in the 
2 CONT vicinity of Mantes, fatally injuring him.  William was succeeded by his 
2 CONT third-born son, William II.

2 CONT Henry II provided for the eventual inheritance of his lands by his older

2 CONT Lion-Hearted, and John were left as Henry's heirs. In 1189, as Henry 
2 CONT neared death, John joined Richard's rebellion against their father, and 
2 CONT when Richard was crowned, he gave John many estates and titles. John tried 
2 CONT but failed to usurp the Crown while Richard was away on the Third Crusade: 
2 CONT Upon returning to England, Richard forgave him. When his brother died in 
2 CONT 1199, John became king. A revolt ensued by the supporters of Arthur of 
2 CONT Brittany, the son of John's brother, Geoffrey. Arthur was defeated and 
2 CONT captured in 1202, and John is believed to have had him murdered. King 
2 CONT Philip II of France continued Arthur's war until John had to surrender 
2 CONT nearly all his French possessions in 1204. In 1207 John refused to accept 
2 CONT the election of Stephen Langton as archbishop of Canterbury. Pope Innocent 
2 CONT III then excommunicated him and began negotiating with Philip for an 
2 CONT invasion of England. Desperate, John surrendered England to the pope and 
2 CONT in 1213 received it back as a fief. Trying to regain his French 
2 CONT possession, he was decisively defeated by Philip in 1214. John's reign had 
2 CONT become increasingly tyrannical; to support his wars he had extorted money, 
2 CONT raised taxes, and confiscated properties. His barons finally united to 
2 CONT force him to respect their rights and privileges. John had little choice 
2 CONT but to sign the Magna Carta presented to him by his barons at Runnymede in 
2 CONT 1215, making him subject, rather than superior, to the law. Shortly 
2 CONT afterward John and the barons were at war. He died while still pursuing 
2 CONT the campaign, and was succeeded by his son, Henry III.

2 CONT nine, on the death of his father. During his minority the kingdom was 
2 CONT ruled by William Marshal, earl of Pembroke, as regent, but after his death 
2 CONT in 1219 the justiciar Hubert de Burgh was the chief power in the 
2 CONT government. During the regency the French, who occupied much of eastern 
2 CONT England, were expelled, and rebellious barons were subdued. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Henry was declared of age in 1227. In 1232 he dismissed Hubert de Burgh 
2 CONT from his court and commenced ruling without the aid of ministers. Henry 
2 CONT displeased the barons by filling government and church offices with 
2 CONT foreign favorites, many of them relatives of his wife, Eleanor of 
2 CONT Provence, whom he married in 1236, and by squandering money on Continental 
2 CONT wars, especially in France. In order to secure the throne of Sicily for

2 CONT requested money from the barons to pay his debt, they refused and in 1258 
2 CONT forced him to agree to the Provisions of Oxford, whereby he agreed to 
2 CONT share his power with a council of barons. Henry soon repudiated his oath,

2 CONT Henry at Lewes, and took him prisoner. In 1265, however, Henry's son and 
2 CONT heir, Edward, later King Edward I, led the royal troops to victory over 
2 CONT the barons at Evesham, about 40.2 km (about 25 mi) south of Birmingham. 
2 CONT Simon de Montfort was killed in the battle, and the barons agreed to a 
2 CONT compromise with Edward and his party in 1267. From that time on Edward 
2 CONT ruled England, and when Henry died, he succeeded him as king.

1 NOTE Edward I, called Longshanks (1239-1307), king of England (1272-1307), Lord 
2 CONT of Gascony, of the house of Plantagenet. He was born in Westminster on 
2 CONT June 17, 1239, the eldest son of King Henry III, and at 15 married Eleanor 
2 CONT of Castile. In the struggles of the barons against the crown for 
2 CONT constitutional and ecclesiastical reforms, Edward took a vacillating 
2 CONT course. When warfare broke out between the crown and the nobility, Edward 
2 CONT fought on the side of the king, winning the decisive battle of Evesham in 
2 CONT 1265. Five years later he left England to join the Seventh Crusade. 
2 CONT Following his father's death in 1272, and while he was still abroad, 
2 CONT Edward was recognized as king by the English barons; in 1273, on his 
2 CONT return to England, he was crowned. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The first years of Edward's reign were a period of the consolidation of 
2 CONT his power. He suppressed corruption in the administration of justice, 
2 CONT restricted the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to church 
2 CONT affairs, and eliminated the papacy's overlordship over England. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the refusal of Llewelyn ab Gruffydd (died 1282), ruler of Wales, to 
2 CONT submit to the English crown, Edward began the military conflict that 
2 CONT resulted, in 1284, in the annexation of Llewelyn's principality to the 
2 CONT English crown. In 1290 Edward expelled all Jews from England. War between 
2 CONT England and France broke out in 1293 as a result of the efforts of France 
2 CONT to curb Edward's power in Gascony. Edward lost Gascony in 1293 and did not 
2 CONT again come into possession of the duchy until 1303. About the same year in 
2 CONT which he lost Gascony, the Welsh rose in rebellion. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Greater than either of these problems was the disaffection of the people 
2 CONT of Scotland. In agreeing to arbitrate among the claimants to the Scottish 
2 CONT throne, Edward, in 1291, had exacted as a prior condition the recognition 
2 CONT by all concerned of his overlordship of Scotland. The Scots later 
2 CONT repudiated him and made an alliance with France against England. To meet 
2 CONT the critical situations in Wales and Scotland, Edward summoned a 
2 CONT parliament, called the Model Parliament by historians because it was a 
2 CONT representative body and in that respect was the forerunner of all future 
2 CONT parliaments. Assured by Parliament of support at home, Edward took the 
2 CONT field and suppressed the Welsh insurrection. In 1296, after invading and 
2 CONT conquering Scotland, he declared himself king of that realm. In 1298 he 
2 CONT again invaded Scotland to suppress the revolt led by Sir William Wallace. 
2 CONT In winning the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, Edward achieved the greatest 
2 CONT military triumph of his career, but he failed to crush Scottish 
2 CONT opposition. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The conquest of Scotland became the ruling passion of his life. He was, 
2 CONT however, compelled by the nobles, clergy, and commons to desist in his 
2 CONT attempts to raise by arbitrary taxes the funds he needed for campaigns. In 
2 CONT 1299 Edward made peace with France and married Margaret, sister of King 
2 CONT Philip III of France. Thus freed of war, he again undertook the conquest 
2 CONT of Scotland in 1303. Wallace was captured and executed in 1305. No sooner 
2 CONT had Edward established his government in Scotland, however, than a new 
2 CONT revolt broke out and culminated in the coronation of Robert Bruce as king 
2 CONT of Scotland. In 1307 Edward set out for the third time to subdue the 
2 CONT Scots, but he died en route near Carlisle on July 7, 1307.  He also had a 
2 CONT daughter with Eleanor of Castile that died young.

1 NOTE 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Philip IV (of France), called The Fair (1268-1314), king of France 
2 CONT (1285-1314), known for his conflict with the papacy. The son and successor 
2 CONT of King Philip III, he was born in Fontainebleau. Through marriage he 
2 CONT became the ruler of Navarre and Champagne. Between 1294 and 1296 he seized 
2 CONT Guienne, in southwestern France, a possession of Edward I, king of 
2 CONT England. In 1297 war ensued with England and with Flanders, England's 
2 CONT ally. Under the terms of a truce made in 1299, Philip withdrew from 
2 CONT Guienne and Edward withdrew from Flanders, leaving it to the French. A 
2 CONT revolt broke out at Bruges, however, and at the Battle of Courtrai in 
2 CONT 1302, the French army was disastrously defeated by Flemish burghers. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The great event of Philip's reign was his struggle with Pope Boniface VII, 
2 CONT which grew out of Philip's attempt to levy taxes against the clergy. By 
2 CONT the bull Clericis Laicos (1296) Boniface forbade the clergy to pay taxes 
2 CONT to a secular power, and Philip replied by forbidding the export of coins, 
2 CONT thereby depriving the pope of French revenues. A temporary reconciliation 
2 CONT was ended by a fresh outbreak of the quarrel when Philip arrested the 
2 CONT papal legate in 1301 and summoned the first French Estates-General. This 
2 CONT assembly, which was composed of clergy, nobles, and burghers, gave support 
2 CONT to Philip. Boniface retaliated with the celebrated bull Unam Sanctam 
2 CONT (1302), a declaration of papal supremacy. Philip's partisans then 
2 CONT imprisoned Boniface. The pope escaped but died soon afterward. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1305 Philip obtained the election of one of his own adherents as pope, 
2 CONT Clement V, and compelled him to reside in France. Thus began the so-called 
2 CONT Babylonian Captivity of the papacy (1309-77), during which the popes lived 
2 CONT at Avignon and were subjected to French control. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1307 Philip arrested Grand Master Jacques de Molay of the Knights 
2 CONT Templars, and in 1312 he forced the pope to suppress the religious and 
2 CONT military order. Their wealth was confiscated by the king, and many members 
2 CONT were burned at the stake. Also, as a result of his financial needs, Philip 
2 CONT greatly increased taxes, debased the coinage several times, and arrested 
2 CONT the Jews and the Lombards (Italian bankers), appropriating the assets of 
2 CONT the former and demanding large subsidies from the latter. He died October 
2 CONT 29, 1314, at Fontainebleau.

2 CONT minority (842-56), and became coruler of the Byzantine Empire with 
2 CONT Michael. In 867 Basil had Michael assassinated. As sole ruler of the

2 CONT mixed it all together until it was fairly uniform - and then sold it in 
2 CONT the market place in Logstor.  He also ran a distillery and sold the liquor 
2 CONT to friends and neighbors.  When the job was done on the farm in the fall, 
2 CONT he took a bag on his shoulder and roamed southward trading his wares.  He 
2 CONT sold scraps, ribbons and lace.  He did very well in business, which helped 
2 CONT him to be able to buy his farm to freehold and later have new buildings 
2 CONT put up.

1 NOTE As a young farm hand, Troels was engaged to a 19-year old girl, Else 
2 CONT Kristine Jensdatter, daughter of farmer Jens Jensen, Bjorumslet.  The 
2 CONT wedding day was set, but two days before, the girl's father came and told 
2 CONT Troels that Else had changed her mind.  It was a hard blow for the quiet 
2 CONT young man, who was much in love with the girl.  Some years later, Troels 
2 CONT got a job with farmer Hans Madsen in Sjostrup, and here he found a good 
2 CONT wife in their daughter, Kristiane.  In Troels and Kristianes' marriage 
2 CONT were 12 children, but all of them died as children.  Troels was in bad 
2 CONT health during his later years, and his leg had to be amputated.

1 NOTE Berengaria (circa 1165-1230), queen consort of King Richard I of England. 
2 CONT She was the daughter of Sancho VI, king of Navarre (1132?-94), and was 
2 CONT betrothed to Richard shortly after his accession to the English throne in 
2 CONT 1189. She joined him in Reggio, Italy, in 1191, while he was traveling to 
2 CONT Palestine on the Third Crusade, and they were married later the same year 
2 CONT in Limassol, Cyprus. From 1191 to 1192, while Richard campaigned against 
2 CONT the Saracens, she lived in Acre in Palestine, and from 1192 to 1194, while 
2 CONT he was a prisoner in Germany, she lived in Poitou (now in France). After 
2 CONT Richard's release from captivity the couple appear to have become 
2 CONT estranged, and modern historians agree that they were probably never 
2 CONT reunited. After Richard's death in 1199, Berengaria spent most of her last

1 NOTE He extended his power into Normandy and Scotland. His father on his 
2 CONT deathbed named him as his successor in England, leaving the duchy of 
2 CONT Normandy to his eldest son, Robert. William Rufus, as he was known because 
2 CONT of his ruddy complexion, was crowned in Westminster Abbey in 1087. The 
2 CONT following year William's uncle Odo, bishop of Bayeux (1036?-97), led a 
2 CONT rebellion of Norman barons who sought to unseat him in favor of Robert. 
2 CONT William's English subjects, believing his promises of less oppressive 
2 CONT taxation and more liberal laws, helped him quell the revolt. The king, 
2 CONT despite his promises, continued to pursue a domestic policy that was harsh 
2 CONT and venal. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT William invaded Normandy in 1089, 1091, and 1094, winning some concessions 
2 CONT from his brother Robert II, duke of Normandy, each time. He forced the 
2 CONT Scottish king Malcolm III MacDuncan (1031?-93) to pay him homage and in 
2 CONT 1092 seized the city of Carlisle and other areas claimed by Malcolm in 
2 CONT Cumberland and Westmorland. In 1096 Robert mortgaged Normandy to William 
2 CONT for funds to finance a Crusade. William then fought to recapture lands his 
2 CONT brother had lost as duke of Normandy and returned the county of Maine to 
2 CONT the rule of the duchy. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After the death in 1089 of Lanfranc, the archbishop of Canterbury, William 
2 CONT delayed naming a successor. He held open vacant bishoprics and enriched 
2 CONT himself with church monies, incurring the displeasure of many 
2 CONT ecclesiastics. In 1093 he selected Anselm, abbot of Bec, as the new 
2 CONT archbishop, but they quarreled over William's authority to control church 
2 CONT appointments. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT William was killed. It is not known whether the slaying, which is 
2 CONT traditionally ascribed to a Norman named Walter Tirel (died after 1100), 
2 CONT was accidental or intentional. William  never married and had no children. 
2 CONT His younger brother succeeded to the throne as King Henry I.

2 CONT brother, and through marriage in 1246 he became count of Provence. In 1248 
2 CONT he accompanied Louis on the Sixth Crusade. In 1250 he was captured and 
2 CONT briefly imprisoned, but later returned to Provence. By 1264 he controlled 
2 CONT much of Piedmont. Charles agreed to aid the pope in his struggle against 
2 CONT the Ghibellines in return for the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In 1265 
2 CONT Charles invaded Italy; the following year the reigning monarch Manfred 
2 CONT (1232?-66) was killed in battle and Charles became king. In 1268, Conradin 
2 CONT (1252-68), nephew of Manfred and last of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, led a

2 CONT suppressed the Ghibelline nobles, seizing their estates to pay his French 
2 CONT soldiers. In 1270 Charles participated in the disastrous Seventh Crusade. 
2 CONT In 1282 he learned of a revolt in Sicily against the French. Charles tried 
2 CONT to reestablish his authority over the island, but was routed by Pedro III, 
2 CONT king of Aragón (1239-85), who destroyed his fleet. Charles died soon

1 NOTE Philip II (of France) (1165-1223), king of France (1180-1223), one of the 
2 CONT most powerful European monarchs of the Middle Ages. His full name was 
2 CONT Philip Augustus. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The son of King Louis VII, Philip was born on August 21, 1165, in Gonesse, 
2 CONT near Paris. He became coregent with his father in 1179. From 1181 to 1186 
2 CONT Philip combated a coalition of barons in Flanders, Burgundy, and Champagne 
2 CONT and at their expense increased the royal domain. Philip allied himself 
2 CONT with Richard, duke of Aquitaine, who in 1189 became Richard I of England, 
2 CONT and in 1190 the two kings embarked on the Third Crusade. The kings 
2 CONT quarreled, however, and Philip returned to France in 1191. Allied with 
2 CONT Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI and Richard's brother, John, later king of 
2 CONT England, Philip attacked Richard's territories in France. Richard returned 
2 CONT in 1194 and went to war against Philip. By the time of Richard's death in 
2 CONT 1199, Philip had been forced to surrender most of the territory he had 
2 CONT annexed. Philip subsequently warred against John, who became king of 
2 CONT England in 1199; between 1202 and 1205 Philip more than doubled his 
2 CONT territory by annexing Normandy, Maine, Brittany, Anjou, Touraine, and 
2 CONT Poitou. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT A coalition of European powers, including England, challenged the growing 
2 CONT power of France in 1214. Philip's forces, however, decisively defeated the 
2 CONT coalition at the Battle of Bouvines, establishing France as a leading 
2 CONT country of Europe. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Philip increased the royal power not only by extending the royal domain 
2 CONT but also by reducing the power of the feudal lords. He replaced the noble 
2 CONT officers at court with an advisory council appointed from the middle class 
2 CONT and supported the communes against the nobles. France prospered from his 
2 CONT judicial, financial, and administrative reorganization of the government; 
2 CONT serfdom declined, towns grew, and commerce flourished. Philip established 
2 CONT Paris as the fixed capital of France, paved the streets, and had many new 
2 CONT buildings constructed in the city.

2 CONT of Aquitaine, daughter of William X, duke of Aquitaine (1099-1137). Louis 
2 CONT soon aroused the opposition of Pope Innocent II (reigned 1130-43) because 
2 CONT of his support of a rival to the papal candidate for the archbishopric of 
2 CONT Bourges, and his lands were placed under papal interdict. Louis next 
2 CONT fought a 2-year war and conquered Champagne in 1144. In 1147 he joined the 
2 CONT unsuccessful Second Crusade as one of its two chief military leaders (the 
2 CONT other was Conrad III of Germany). Louis returned to France two years 
2 CONT later, and in 1152 his marriage to Eleanor was annulled; in the same year 
2 CONT she married Henry of Anjou, later Henry II, king of England. Louis warred 
2 CONT with Henry for the possession of Aquitaine but renounced all rights to the 
2 CONT duchy in 1154, the year Henry became king of England. Between 1157 and 
2 CONT 1180 Louis continued sporadic warfare against Henry, who held many of the 
2 CONT French provinces. Louis was succeeded by his son Philip II (Philip 
2 CONT Augustus).

1 NOTE Hugh Capet (circa 938-96), king of France, and founder of the Capetian 
2 CONT dynasty, son of Hugh the Great, count of Paris, whom he succeeded in 956. 
2 CONT His lordship over many fiefs around Paris and Orléans made him the virtual 
2 CONT ruler of France, and when King Louis V (born 966?) of France, the last of 
2 CONT the Carolingian line, died without an heir in 987, Hugh's numerous vassals 
2 CONT enabled him to win the election to the throne, defeating the Carolingian 
2 CONT candidate, Charles, duke of Lorraine (953-92). Charles and many other 
2 CONT great nobles of the realm attempted to resist his authority but, through 
2 CONT force of arms and by judicious purchasing of allegiance, as well as 
2 CONT through the support of the church, of which he was a devout member, Hugh 
2 CONT established a measure of order within his kingdom. He had his son, Robert 
2 CONT the Pious (later Robert II), elected and crowned his associate and 
2 CONT successor in 988, thereby confirming the house of Capet, which ruled

2 CONT of the English army, led by the Black Prince, that defeated the army of 
2 CONT Henry (later Henry II, king of Castile and León) at Najera in 1367. As a 
2 CONT result of his second marriage, to Constance, daughter of Pedro III the 
2 CONT Cruel (king of Castile and León), John laid claim to the throne of 
2 CONT Castile. During the Hundred Years' War, he aided (1370-71) the Black 
2 CONT Prince against France and established English rule over most of southern 
2 CONT France. After a severe illness forced the return of the Black Prince to 
2 CONT England, John took command of the English armies; by 1380 he had lost much 
2 CONT of the territory the English had previously won. In 1386 John invaded 
2 CONT Castile, but was defeated by John I, king of Castile and León. John of 
2 CONT Gaunt gave up his claim to Castile and León in 1387, when his daughter 
2 CONT married Henry, later Henry III, king of Castile and León. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT John of Gaunt was also prominent in English affairs. Together with Alice 
2 CONT Perrers (d. 1400), his father's mistress, John dominated the English 
2 CONT government. His rule was opposed by Parliament and by the Black Prince. In 
2 CONT 1376 Parliament banished Alice Perrers and curtailed John's powers. The 
2 CONT death of the Black Prince that year and the dissolution of Parliament, 
2 CONT however, enabled John to regain his power. In 1377, on the death of Edward 
2 CONT III and the accession of Richard II (John's nephew and son of the Black 
2 CONT Prince), John gave up his control of the government and thereafter played 
2 CONT the role of peacemaker; he also supported the king, by whom he was made 
2 CONT (1390) duke of Aquitaine. In 1396, after the death of his second wife, 
2 CONT John married his mistress Catherine Swynford and Richard legitimized their 
2 CONT children the following year. Saddened by the exile (1398) of his son, 
2 CONT Henry of Lancaster (later King Henry IV of England), John died.

1 NOTE Edward III (1312-77), king of England (1327-77), Earl of Chester, Duke of 
2 CONT Aquitaine, who initiated the long, drawn-out struggle with France called 
2 CONT the Hundred Years' War. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Edward was born at Windsor on November 13, 1312, the elder son of King 
2 CONT Edward II, of the house of Plantagenet. Involved by his mother, Isabella 
2 CONT of France (1292-1358), in her intrigues against his father, he was 
2 CONT proclaimed king after the latter was forced to abdicate in 1327. During 
2 CONT Edward's minority, England was nominally ruled by a council of regency, 
2 CONT but the actual power was in the hands of Isabella and her paramour, Roger 
2 CONT de Mortimer (1287?-1330). In 1330, however, the young king staged a palace 
2 CONT coup and took the power into his own hands. He had Mortimer hanged and 
2 CONT confined his mother to her home. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Edward began a series of wars almost directly after he had control of 
2 CONT England. Taking advantage of civil war in Scotland in 1333, he invaded the 
2 CONT country, defeated the Scots at Halidon Hill, England, and restored Edward 
2 CONT de Baliol to the throne of Scotland. Baliol, however, was soon deposed, 
2 CONT and later attempts by Edward to establish him permanently as king of 
2 CONT Scotland were unsuccessful. In 1337 France came to the aid of Scotland. 
2 CONT This action was the culminating point in a series of disagreements between 
2 CONT France and England, and Edward declared war on Philip VI of France. In 
2 CONT 1340 the English fleet destroyed a larger French fleet off Sluis, the 
2 CONT Netherlands. The action resulted in a truce that, although occasionally 
2 CONT disturbed, lasted for six years. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT War broke out again in 1346. Edward, accompanied by his eldest son, Edward 
2 CONT the Black Prince, invaded Normandy and won a great victory over France in 
2 CONT the Battle of Crécy. He captured Calais in 1347, and a truce was 
2 CONT reestablished. Edward returned to England, where he maintained one of the 
2 CONT most magnificent courts in Europe. The war with France was renewed in 
2 CONT 1355, and again the English armies were successful. The Peace of Calais, 
2 CONT in 1360, gave England all of Aquitaine, and Edward in return renounced his 
2 CONT claim, first made in 1328, to the French throne. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Edward continued to assert his will both domestically and abroad. In 1363 
2 CONT he concluded an agreement with his brother-in-law, David II of Scotland, 
2 CONT uniting the two kingdoms in the event of David's death without male issue. 
2 CONT Three years later Edward repudiated the papacy's feudal supremacy over 
2 CONT England, held in fief since 1213. He renewed his war with France, 
2 CONT disavowing the Peace of Calais. This time, however, the English armies 
2 CONT were unsuccessful. After the truce of 1375, Edward retained few of his 
2 CONT previously vast possessions in France. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The king had, by this time, become senile. He was completely in the power 
2 CONT of an avaricious mistress, Alice Perrers (flourished 1366-1400), who, 
2 CONT along with his fourth son, John of Gaunt, dominated England. Perrers was 
2 CONT banished by Parliament in 1376, and Edward himself died at Sheen (now 
2 CONT Richmond) on June 21, 1377. He was succeeded by his grandson, Richard II.

2 CONT Wales, and Duke of Aquitaine, whose incompetence and distaste for 
2 CONT government finally led to his deposition and murder. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Edward was born on April 25, 1284, at Caernarvon, Wales, the fourth son of 
2 CONT King Edward I and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile. The deaths of his 
2 CONT older brothers made the infant prince heir to the throne; in 1301 he was 
2 CONT proclaimed prince of Wales, the first heir apparent in English history to 
2 CONT bear that title. The prince was idle and frivolous, with no liking for 
2 CONT military campaigning or affairs of state. Believing that the prince's 
2 CONT close friend Piers Gaveston (died 1312), a Gascon knight, was a bad 
2 CONT influence on the prince, Edward I banished Gaveston. On his father's 
2 CONT death, however, Edward II recalled his favorite. Gavestone incurred the 
2 CONT opposition of the powerful English barony. The nobles were particularly 
2 CONT angered in 1308, when Edward made Gaveston regent for the period of the 
2 CONT king's absence in France, where he went to marry Isabella (1292-1358), 
2 CONT daughter of King Philip IV. In 1311 the barons, led by Thomas, earl of 
2 CONT Lancaster (1277?-1322), forced the king to appoint from among them a 
2 CONT committee of 21 noblemen and prelates, call the lords ordainers. They 
2 CONT proclaimed a series of ordinances that transferred the ruling power to 
2 CONT themselves and excluded the commons and lower clergy from Parliament. 
2 CONT After they had twice forced the king to banish Gaveston, and the king had 
2 CONT each time recalled him, the barons finally had the king's favorite 
2 CONT kidnapped and executed (1312). 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In the meantime Robert Bruce had almost completed his reconquest of 
2 CONT Scotland, which he had begun shortly after 1305. In 1314 Edward II and his 
2 CONT barons raised an army of some 100,000 men, with which to crush Bruce, but 
2 CONT in the attempt to lift the siege of Stirling were decisively defeated (see 
2 CONT Bannockburn, Battle of). For the following eight years the earl of 
2 CONT Lancaster viturally ruled the kingdom. In 1322, however, with the advice 
2 CONT and help of two new royal favorites, the baron Hugh le Despenser the 
2 CONT Elder, and his son Hugh the Younger, Edward defeated Lancaster in battle 
2 CONT and had him executed. The Despensers thereupon became de facto rulers of 
2 CONT England. They summoned a Parliament in which the commons were included and 
2 CONT which repealed the ordinances of 1311 on the ground they had been passed 
2 CONT by the barons only. The repeal was a great step forward in English 
2 CONT constitutional development, for it meant that thenceforth no law passed by 
2 CONT Parliament was valid unless the House of Comman approved it. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Edward again futilely invaded Scotland in 1322, and in 1323 signed a 
2 CONT 13-year truce with Bruce. In 1325 Queen Isabella accompanied the prince of 
2 CONT Wales to France, where, in accordance with feudal custom, he did homage to 
2 CONT king Charles IV for the fief of Aquitaine. Isabella, who desired to depose 
2 CONT the Despensers, allied herself with some barons who had been exiled by 
2 CONT Edward. In 1326, with their leader Roger de Mortimer (1287?-1330) Isabella 
2 CONT raised an army and invaded England. Edward and his favorites fled, but his 
2 CONT wife's army pursued and executed the Despensers and imprisoned Edward. In 
2 CONT January 1327, Parliament forced Edward to resign and proclaimed the prince 
2 CONT of Wales king as Edward III.On September 21 of that year Edward II was 
2 CONT murdered by his captors at Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire.

1 NOTE Edward, called the Black Prince (1330-76), prince of Wales, who 
2 CONT distinguished himself as a military leader during the Hundred Years' War. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Edward was born at Woodstock in Oxfordshire on June 15, 1330, the son of 
2 CONT King Edward III of England. During his lifetime, he was called Edward of 
2 CONT Woodstock; the name Black Prince was given him because of the black armor 
2 CONT he wore. In 1346 Edward accompanied his father on the English campaign in 
2 CONT Normandy, and during the Battle of Crecy, when he was only 16, the prince 
2 CONT won high acclaim for his command of the right wing of the English army. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1355 Edward was appointed his father's lieutenant in Gascony. He led 
2 CONT the English army in a series of raids across southern France and in 1356 
2 CONT defeated a French army at Poitiers, took King John II of France prisoner, 
2 CONT and returned in triumph to England with his captive. In 1361 he married 
2 CONT his cousin Joan, countess of Kent (1328-85) known as the fair maid of 
2 CONT Kent. A year later his father created him prince of Aquitaine and Gascony, 
2 CONT and he went to his domains in southern France. As lord of those lands, 
2 CONT Edward became, under feudal law, a vassal of the French king. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During his rule the prince estranged the Gascon nobles, who believed that 
2 CONT he was curtailing their feudal rights. After almost six years of peace, 
2 CONT Edward, in 1367, led an expedition to Spain in order to restore Peter the 
2 CONT Cruel, the deposed king of Castile, to his throne. During the successful 
2 CONT Spanish campaign, Edward contracted an illness from which he never 
2 CONT recovered; Peter furthermore refused to repay Edward the vast sums that 
2 CONT had been expended on his behalf. On his return to Aquitaine, the prince 
2 CONT levied taxes to pay for the expedition, but the disgruntled nobles 
2 CONT protested to Edward's feudal lord, King Charles V of France. The prince 
2 CONT refused to answer to the charges against him, and Charles renewed the war 
2 CONT against England. A revolt against Edward spread through Aquitaine and 
2 CONT Gascony, and despite his illness the prince led his troops against the 
2 CONT city of Limoges, capturing it in 1370 and massacring its defenders. A year 
2 CONT later he returned to England and resigned his principality. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During the last years of his life, Edward was a leader of the political 
2 CONT faction that rebelled against the misrule of his younger brother, John of 
2 CONT Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. Edward finally succumbed to his illness and died 
2 CONT at Westminster on June 8, 1376. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, in 
2 CONT which parts of his armor still hang.  He was also duke of Cornwall and 
2 CONT earl of Chester.

1 NOTE Richard II (1367-1400), king of England (1377-99), whose reign was marked 
2 CONT by national disunity and civil strife. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT A younger son of Edward, prince of Wales (the Black Prince), and Joan, 
2 CONT called the Fair Maid of Kent (1328-85), Richard was born January 6, 1367, 
2 CONT in Bordeaux, France. He was created prince of Wales in 1376, the year of 
2 CONT his father's death, and was placed in the care of his uncle John of Gaunt, 
2 CONT duke of Lancaster. In 1377, on the death of his grandfather, King Edward 
2 CONT III, Richard became ruler of England, then a country devastated by plague 
2 CONT and oppressed by heavy taxes, the result of a war with France. Parliament, 
2 CONT which had obtained greater power in the last years of Edward III's reign, 
2 CONT now sought to secure control of the government, but was opposed by John of 
2 CONT Gaunt and his followers. The speedy suppression of Tyler's Rebellion in 
2 CONT 1381 was largely the result of Richard's courage and daring. A year later, 
2 CONT at the age of 15, Richard married Anne of Bohemia (1366-94), daughter of 
2 CONT the Holy Roman emperor Charles IV, and began to seek the downfall of the 
2 CONT great nobles who controlled Parliament and prevented him from acting 
2 CONT independently. Led by Richard's uncle Thomas of Woodstock, duke of 
2 CONT Gloucester (1355-97), in 1388 a coterie of noblemen known in history as 
2 CONT the lords appellant appealed or accused Richard's adherents of treason, 
2 CONT banishing some and having others executed. The following year Richard, 
2 CONT with the help of John of Gaunt, succeeded in asserting his authority. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Trying to reestablish English authority in Ireland, Richard led an 
2 CONT expedition to the country in 1394; that same year his queen died. In 1396 
2 CONT a marriage treaty was concluded between Richard and a French princess, 
2 CONT Isabella (1389-1409). In 1397 Richard had Gloucester arrested and 
2 CONT imprisoned at Calais, where he died, perhaps murdered. He also exiled John 
2 CONT of Gaunt's son, Henry Bolingbroke, duke of Hereford, who later became 
2 CONT Richard's successor as Henry IV, and executed or banished others of the 
2 CONT lords appellant. On his return from a second military expedition to 
2 CONT Ireland in 1399 Richard found that Bolingbroke had returned from exile and 
2 CONT placed himself at the head of a formidable army. Richard was captured by 
2 CONT Bolingbroke in Wales and brought captive to London, where on September 30, 
2 CONT 1399, he formally resigned his crown. On the following day his abdication 
2 CONT was ratified by Parliament, which then confirmed Bolingbroke as King Henry 
2 CONT IV. Richard was secretly confined in Pontefract Castle, where he either 
2 CONT died of starvation or was murdered in February 1400.

1 NOTE He was also duke of Heresford and Lancaster, the first king of the house 
2 CONT of Lancaster. He was also known as Henry of Lancaster and Henry of 
2 CONT Bolingbroke. From 1387 to 1390 he was a leader of the party that opposed 
2 CONT his cousin King Richard II. Henry subsequently fought with the Teutonic 
2 CONT Knights against the Lithuanians and made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. After 
2 CONT his return to England he allied himself with the king. Because of a 
2 CONT quarrel with Thomas Mowbray, 1st duke of Norfolk, in 1398, Henry was 
2 CONT exiled for six years by Richard, who promised that Henry would not lose 
2 CONT his inheritance. When Henry's father died, however, Richard confiscated 
2 CONT the Lancastrian estates willed to Henry. Consequently, Henry raised an 
2 CONT army, invaded England, and captured Richard, who later abdicated. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1399 Henry was elected king by Parliament. The following year he 
2 CONT suppressed a revolt of nobles who supported Richard. The Scots and the 
2 CONT Welsh, aided by the French, then began a rebellion against the English 
2 CONT crown. The Scots were defeated (1402) at Humbleton Hill, but the Welsh 
2 CONT continued the rebellion for seven years under the leadership of the Welsh 
2 CONT chief Owen Glendower. In 1403 the Percy family rebelled against Henry 
2 CONT because they were dissatisfied with the rewards for service he had 
2 CONT bestowed upon them; they were defeated in the Battle of Shrewsbury in the 
2 CONT same year. Wars and rebellions persisted after that date but diminished in 
2 CONT number. During his reign Henry IV persecuted the religious sect known as 
2 CONT the Lollards. He was succeeded by his son, Henry V.

1 NOTE Henry V (of England) (1387-1422), king of England (1413-22) and Prince of 
2 CONT Wales, known for his victorious campaigns against France, born at Monmouth 
2 CONT in August or September 1387. He was the son and successor of Henry IV. In 
2 CONT 1403 Henry led the royal army that defeated the rebellious Percy family, 
2 CONT led by Sir Henry Percy, at Shrewsbury. He also commanded the English 
2 CONT forces that put down the revolt of the Welsh chief Owen Glendower. In 
2 CONT 1410-11, when his father was incapacitated by illness, Henry headed the 
2 CONT royal council, but was removed after a political quarrel with his father. 
2 CONT On succeeding to the throne in 1413 Henry V restored Sir Henry Percy's son 
2 CONT to his lands and titles; he also honorably reburied at Westminster Abbey 
2 CONT the remains of Richard II, who had been deposed by Henry IV and had died 
2 CONT in prison during the latter's reign. The new king continued his father's 
2 CONT policy in persecuting the religious sect known as the Lollards and 
2 CONT executed their leader, Sir John Oldcastle, in 1417. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1415 Henry warred against France, winning in that same year the Battle 
2 CONT of Agincourt. The following year he allied himself with the Holy Roman 
2 CONT emperor Sigismund, and in 1417 he began the conquest of Normandy, 
2 CONT completing it with the capture of Rouen two years later. He concluded a 
2 CONT peace treaty with Charles VI of France at Troyes in 1420, obtaining 
2 CONT Charles's daughter, Catherine of Valois, in marriage and securing the 
2 CONT promise of succession to the French throne on the death of Charles. When 
2 CONT Henry returned to England in 1421, leaving his brother Thomas, duke of 
2 CONT Clarence (1389?-1421), as governor of Normandy, the French rose in 
2 CONT opposition to English rule and defeated the duke. Henry returned to France 
2 CONT for a third campaign, but he became ill and died. He was the most 
2 CONT influential ruler in western Europe at the time of his death in Vincennes, 
2 CONT France, August 31, 1422. He was succeeded by his son Henry VI.

1 NOTE He was also duke of Cornwall and the last king of the house of Lancaster. 
2 CONT He never showed any aptitude for government, and throughout his reign the 
2 CONT English court was dominated by competing aristocratic factions. Like his 
2 CONT father, he claimed the crown of France, but France gradually freed itself 
2 CONT from English control between 1430 and 1453.  During the 1450s a group of 
2 CONT nobles sought to replace him with Richard, duke of York, the next in line 
2 CONT of succession to the throne. The resulting civil conflict between the 
2 CONT houses of Lancaster and York, known as the Wars of the Roses, began in 
2 CONT 1455. After intermittent fighting Henry was captured by the Yorkists at 
2 CONT Northampton and was compelled to acknowledge Richard rather than his own 
2 CONT infant son as successor. In 1460 Richard was killed by Henry's forces at 
2 CONT Wakefield. Richard's son subsequently became leader of the Yorkists and 
2 CONT proclaimed himself king as Edward IV. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Henry and his queen escaped to Scotland, where they remained until 1464. 
2 CONT In that year he returned to take part in a rebellion against Edward but 
2 CONT was captured (1465) and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He had suffered 
2 CONT attacks of insanity all his life and was now completely incapacitated. 
2 CONT Nevertheless, he became nominal ruler again in 1470. Dethroned the 
2 CONT following year and returned to the tower by Edward, he died there, 
2 CONT probably murdered on Edward's order. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Henry, who founded Eton College and King's College, University of 
2 CONT Cambridge, was venerated by many as a saint because of his piety.

1 NOTE Henry VII (of England), often called Henry Tudor (1457-1509), king of 
2 CONT England (1485-1509) and first ruler of the house of Tudor, whose reign 
2 CONT initiated a period of national unity following the strife of the 15th 
2 CONT century. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Henry, the son of Edmund Tudor, earl of Richmond (1430?-56), and Margaret 
2 CONT Beaufort, countess of Richmond and Derby (a direct descendant of John of 
2 CONT Gaunt, duke of Lancaster), was born on January 28, 1457, in Pembroke 
2 CONT Castle, Pembrokeshire. After the Yorkist king Edward IV seized the throne 
2 CONT from the Lancastrian Henry VI in 1471, Henry Tudor, a Lancastrian, took 
2 CONT refuge in Brittany. He became head of the house of Lancaster on the death 
2 CONT of Henry VI in the same year. In 1483, taking advantage of the indignation 
2 CONT aroused against Edward's successor, Richard III, whose nephews, Edward V 
2 CONT and Richard, duke of York (1472-83), were murdered in the Tower of London, 
2 CONT presumably on Richard's order, Henry crossed over to Wales, where he 
2 CONT gathered an army of supporters. In 1485, at Bosworth Field in England, he 
2 CONT met and defeated Richard, who was killed during the battle. Henry Tudor 
2 CONT was subsequently crowned Henry VII in London. In the following year he 
2 CONT married the Yorkist heiress, Elizabeth (1465-1503), eldest daughter of 
2 CONT Edward IV, uniting the houses of York and Lancaster and ending the Wars of 
2 CONT the Roses. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After his accession Henry had to contend with several Yorkist uprisings, 
2 CONT notably one led by the English impostor Lambert Simnel (circa 1471-1534), 
2 CONT who claimed to be Edward, earl of Warwick (1475-99), the last Yorkist 
2 CONT claimant to the throne. The real earl of Warwick was actually imprisoned 
2 CONT by Henry in the Tower of London at the time. Another revolt was led by the 
2 CONT Walloon impostor Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard, duke of York, 
2 CONT the younger of the murdered sons of Edward IV. Although both impostors had 
2 CONT strong backing in England and abroad, their forces were defeated by Henry. 
2 CONT In 1494 Henry sent the English statesman Sir Edward Poynings (1459-1521) 
2 CONT to Ireland to reestablish English control in that country. Henry managed 
2 CONT to maintain peaceful relations with Austria, Spain, and France throughout 
2 CONT most of his years as king. The reorganization in 1487 of the Star Chamber 
2 CONT was one of several means by which Henry strengthened the royal power over 
2 CONT the nobles. He died in Richmond, Surrey, on April 21, 1509, and was 
2 CONT succeeded by his second son, Henry VIII.

1 NOTE Also duke of York, who established the house of York on the English 
2 CONT throne. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He inherited the title earl of March. During the Wars of the Roses, and 
2 CONT following defeat in the Battle of Ludlow in 1459, Edward was driven from 
2 CONT England by the Lancastrian king Henry VI. After his return to England and 
2 CONT the death of his father in the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, Edward became 
2 CONT head of the house of York. He defeated the Lancastrians in the Battle of 
2 CONT Mortimer's Cross in 1461 and was acclaimed king by Parliament, which also 
2 CONT declared Henry VI a usurper and traitor. Edward was crowned in June 1461. 
2 CONT In giving thanks in person to the House of Commons, he set a historic 
2 CONT precedent. Despite the civil war that continued intermittently until 1471, 
2 CONT when all Lancastrian resistance was crushed and Henry VI was taken 
2 CONT prisoner, Edward fostered the commerce of his realm. During his reign, 
2 CONT printing and silk manufacturing were introduced in England. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, a commoner, and his efforts to 
2 CONT create a new nobility more amenable to his interests, angered the older 
2 CONT nobles and alienated Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, who had been a 
2 CONT power behind his throne. Warwick made an alliance with the Lancastrians 
2 CONT and, in 1470, drove Edward from the throne and into exile in Holland. 
2 CONT Henry VI again became king of England. Supplied with funds by his 
2 CONT brother-in-law, Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, Edward returned to 
2 CONT England in 1471, raised a large army, and won decisive victories over his 
2 CONT enemies at Barnet and Tewkesbury. Thereafter the crown was securely in his 
2 CONT possession. The later years of his reign were, for the most part, 
2 CONT uneventful. The most notable incident of this period was a short war with 
2 CONT France in 1475, which was terminated by an arrangement whereby King Louis 
2 CONT XI agreed to pay Edward an annual subsidy. Edward was succeeded by his son 
2 CONT Edward V.

1 NOTE He was the founder of the Church of England.  He profoundly influenced the

2 CONT succeeded to the throne.  At the beginning of his reign, Henry's good

2 CONT military prowess endeared him to his subjects. A monarch of the period

2 CONT A Question of Divorce
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1511 Henry joined in the Holy League against France, and in 1513 he led 
2 CONT the English forces through a victorious campaign in northern France. 
2 CONT Deserted by his allies, Henry arranged a marriage in 1514 between his 
2 CONT sister Mary (1496-1533) and Louis XII of France, with whom he formed an 
2 CONT alliance. Louis's successor, Francis I, met Henry at a magnificently 
2 CONT staged meeting on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, but no 
2 CONT significant political decisions resulted from this meeting. In 1525 riots 
2 CONT broke out in England in protest against an attempt by Henry to levy taxes 
2 CONT for military purposes, and he withdrew from major military activity in 
2 CONT Europe. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1527 Henry announced his desire to divorce his wife, on the grounds 
2 CONT that the papal dispensation making the marriage possible was invalid. The 
2 CONT chief reason for the divorce was that Catherine had failed to produce a 
2 CONT male heir. Her only surviving child was Mary, later Mary I of England. In 
2 CONT addition, Henry was in love with Anne Boleyn, a young and beautiful 
2 CONT lady-in-waiting of the queen. Several obstacles, however, stood in the way 
2 CONT of the divorce. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Catherine's nephew, strongly 
2 CONT opposed the divorce, and Pope Clement VII, whom Charles had made a 
2 CONT prisoner, could not invalidate the marriage without displeasing his 
2 CONT captor. In 1528 the pope was persuaded to appoint the English cardinal and 
2 CONT statesman Thomas Wolsey and Lorenzo Campeggio (1474-1539), a papal legate, 
2 CONT to try the case in an English legatine court. In 1529, the pope summoned 
2 CONT the case to Rome. When the prospect of securing a papal annulment seemed 
2 CONT hopeless, Henry dismissed Wolsey and appointed Sir Thomas More. The 
2 CONT latter, however, was reluctant to support the divorce. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Break with the Papacy
2 CONT 
2 CONT Henry now proceeded to dissolve one by one the ties to the papacy. With 
2 CONT the aid of parliamentary legislation, he first secured control of the 
2 CONT clergy, compelling that group in 1532 to acknowledge him as head of the 
2 CONT English church. In the following year Henry secretly married Anne Boleyn, 
2 CONT who was crowned queen after Henry's obedient archbishop of Canterbury, 
2 CONT Thomas Cranmer, declared the marriage with Catherine void and that with 
2 CONT Anne valid. An act of succession affirmed the declaration of the 
2 CONT archbishop and established Anne's progeny as heirs to the throne. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although Henry was immediately excommunicated, he repudiated papal 
2 CONT jurisdiction in 1534 and made himself the supreme ecclesiastical authority 
2 CONT in England. The English people were required to affirm under oath Henry's 
2 CONT supremacy and the act of succession. Sir Thomas More and the English 
2 CONT cardinal John Fisher were executed for refusing to accept the religious 
2 CONT supremacy of the English monarch. Henry dissolved the monastic communities 
2 CONT and gave much of their property to the nobles in exchange for their 
2 CONT support. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1536, after charging Anne Boleyn with incest and adultery, Henry had 
2 CONT her executed. A few days after Anne's death, Henry married Jane Seymour, 
2 CONT who died in 1537 after bearing Henry's only legitimate son, Edward, later 
2 CONT Edward VI. A marriage was arranged in 1540 with Anne of Cleves (1515-57) 
2 CONT in order to form a tie between England and the Protestant princes of 
2 CONT Germany. Because Anne was unattractive and because Henry found the 
2 CONT political alliance no longer to his advantage, he divorced her after 
2 CONT several months and married Catherine Howard in the same year. She was 
2 CONT executed summarily in 1542 for having been unchaste prior to marriage and 
2 CONT having committed adultery. In the following year Henry married his sixth 
2 CONT wife, Catherine Parr, who survived him. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Between 1542 and 1546 Henry was involved in war with Scotland and France. 
2 CONT His troops defeated the Scots at Solway Moss in 1542. They captured 
2 CONT Boulogne-sur-Mer from the French in 1544, and when peace was made in 1546 
2 CONT Henry received an indemnity from France. He died in London on January 28, 
2 CONT 1547. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Effects of Henry's Reign
2 CONT 
2 CONT Although he altered the church, Henry did not wish to introduce Protestant 
2 CONT doctrine. Those who refused to accept Church of England teachings as well 
2 CONT as those who rejected Henry's authority over the church were executed. The 
2 CONT licensing of an English translation of the Bible, the issuance of 
2 CONT Cranmer's litany, and the translation into English of certain parts of the 
2 CONT traditional service were the only important religious changes made during 
2 CONT Henry's reign. In terms of the monarchy, he intensified the authoritarian 
2 CONT elements characteristic of the Tudor dynasty to which he belonged. The 
2 CONT great strength of government developed by Henry was used powerfully in the 
2 CONT reign of Elizabeth I, his daughter by Anne Boleyn.

1 NOTE She, as the first wife of King Henry VIII, occupies a prominent place in 
2 CONT history because the question of her marriage to Henry was a factor in the 
2 CONT Reformation in England.  Henry's father, King Henry VII, hoped to form a 
2 CONT binding alliance with Spain when he negotiated the marriage of Catherine 
2 CONT and his son Arthur, prince of Wales. She went to England in 1501 and was 
2 CONT married in November, but Arthur died in April 1502. A few months later 
2 CONT Henry VII arranged a second marriage for Catherine with his second son 
2 CONT Henry, then 12 years old. A papal dispensation enabling Henry to marry the 
2 CONT widow of his brother was obtained in 1503. Henry succeeded to the throne 
2 CONT in April 1509 and in June he married Catherine. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although the marriage was, on the whole, fairly successful, the 
2 CONT pro-Spanish sympathies of Catherine brought some difficulties during the 
2 CONT periods of French alliance. Catherine bore Henry six children, only one of 
2 CONT whom, a daughter, later Queen Mary I, survived. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1527 Henry tried to annul his marriage to Catherine so that he could 
2 CONT marry Anne Boleyn, who he hoped would give him a male heir to the throne. 
2 CONT The pope refused to make a decision on the proposed annulment, and in 1533 
2 CONT Henry was married to Anne by the archbishop of Canterbury. In 1534 the 
2 CONT pope finally declared that the first marriage was valid, thus bringing 
2 CONT about the alienation of Henry VIII from the Roman Catholic church. 
2 CONT Catherine did not quit the kingdom, but was thereafter closely guarded. 
2 CONT During this time she displayed heroic courage and steadfastly refused to 
2 CONT sign away her rights and those of Mary.

1 NOTE On the death of her half brother, Edward VI, on July 6, 1553, she became 
2 CONT the legal heir to the throne. Lord High Chamberlain John Dudley, duke of 
2 CONT Northumberland, however, favored the succession of his daughter-in-law, 
2 CONT Lady Jane Grey. He proclaimed her queen on July 10, but the country 
2 CONT supported Mary. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Mary began her reign by sweeping away the religious innovations of her 
2 CONT father. Mass was restored without opposition and the authority of the pope 
2 CONT reestablished, but Parliament refused to restore the church lands seized 
2 CONT under Henry VIII. Mary, however, restored the property that the Crown 
2 CONT still possessed. Even more disastrous was her marriage to Philip II, king 
2 CONT of Spain. The engagement was greeted in England by a formidable rebellion 
2 CONT under the leadership of Sir Thomas Wyatt (1521-54) to depose Mary and put 
2 CONT her half sister, Elizabeth, later Elizabeth I, on the throne. Philip was 
2 CONT an uncompromising Roman Catholic and unpopular in England. At his order, 
2 CONT Mary joined in a war against France, with the result that Calais, the last 
2 CONT remnant of the English conquests won during the Hundred Years' War with 
2 CONT France, was lost in 1558. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The ferocity with which Mary's personal character has been assailed by 
2 CONT certain writers must be ascribed to religious zeal. She was called Bloody 
2 CONT Mary because of a large number of religious persecutions that took place 
2 CONT during her reign; almost 300 people were condemned to death as a result of

2 CONT Anne returned to England and was courted by the heir to the earldom of

1 NOTE She was the last of the Tudor rulers of England. Although her legitimacy 
2 CONT was questioned and never settled (because an act of Parliament [1536] 
2 CONT invalidated the marriage of her parents and enabled Henry to marry his 
2 CONT third wife, Jane Seymour), both Parliament and Henry named as heirs to 
2 CONT this throne his children Edward, later Edward VI; Mary, later Mary I; and 
2 CONT Elizabeth, in that order. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Childhood and Accession as Queen
2 CONT 
2 CONT Elizabeth spent her childhood away from the court and received an 
2 CONT excellent classical education under such scholars as Roger Ascham, who 
2 CONT influenced her greatly. Henry's sixth wife, Catherine Parr, later became 
2 CONT fond of the young Elizabeth and brought her back to court. She remained in 
2 CONT Catherine's charge after Henry's death and took no part in the political 
2 CONT intrigues following the coronation of her brother as King Edward VI. When 
2 CONT Edward died, Elizabeth became a partisan of her sister Mary, refusing to 
2 CONT support the revolt led by the English soldier and conspirator Sir Thomas 
2 CONT Wyatt (1521?-54) against Mary, who became queen in 1553. Nevertheless, 
2 CONT Mary, a devout Roman Catholic, was made uneasy by the Protestantism of 
2 CONT Elizabeth and her potential menace as an heir to the throne. In 1554, 
2 CONT Elizabeth was imprisoned on the false charge of having been implicated in 
2 CONT Wyatt's rebellion. She was later released, having outwardly professed 
2 CONT Roman Catholicism, and regained Mary's favor. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT At the death of Mary in 1558, Elizabeth became queen, beginning one of the 
2 CONT greatest reigns in English history. At the time of Elizabeth's accession, 
2 CONT England was torn by religious strife, was economically insecure, and was 
2 CONT involved in a disastrous war with France. To these problems Elizabeth 
2 CONT brought a thorough education, innate shrewdness, and a skill in diplomacy 
2 CONT that she had constantly exercised during the reigns of Edward and Mary, 
2 CONT when one mistake might have meant her death. Although she was excessively 
2 CONT vain and capricious, her monarchial duties were always her primary 
2 CONT concern. Her policies and her colorful personality made her extremely 
2 CONT popular with her subjects. Elizabeth's statecraft was due, to a great 
2 CONT extent, to her choice of able and wise advisers, most notably Sir Francis 
2 CONT Walsingham and William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Religion was Elizabeth's initial problem as queen. She reverted to 
2 CONT Protestantism immediately after Mary's death, and her first Parliament 
2 CONT (1559) had a Protestant majority. Between 1559 and 1563, this Parliament 
2 CONT passed religious legislation that became the doctrinal basis of the Church 
2 CONT of England. In the Elizabethan Compromise (1559), the Church of England 
2 CONT became the established church, and throughout Elizabeth's reign Roman 
2 CONT Catholics and Puritans were persecuted. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT A Popular Queen
2 CONT 
2 CONT Elizabeth's domination of the period to which her name became attached was 
2 CONT due in part to the exuberant national spirit that she inspired and that 
2 CONT characterized all England during the second half of the 16th century. She 
2 CONT restored popular confidence in the monarchy, and a wave of prosperity 
2 CONT swept every field of endeavor. With the religious question settled and the 
2 CONT war with France concluded by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559), 
2 CONT England was able to develop industrially and economically. Under 
2 CONT Elizabeth's direction, the government began to regulate commerce and 
2 CONT industry on a national scale. England grew to be a great maritime power 
2 CONT with the exploits of such mariners as Sir Francis Drake and Sir Martin 
2 CONT Frobisher. A new system of standard coinage was introduced in 1560 to 
2 CONT replace the silver coins that had been considerably debased during the 
2 CONT preceding three reigns. As a result, prices fell to normal levels and 
2 CONT confidence in English money was restored. Foreign trade, encouraged by the 
2 CONT government, became a great capitalistic enterprise. The Royal Exchange of 
2 CONT London was opened in 1566, and the company of merchants that later became 
2 CONT the English East India Company was chartered in 1600. Above all this 
2 CONT activity stood the figure of Elizabeth. In the eyes of her subjects, 
2 CONT Elizabeth was England. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT From the beginning of her reign, Elizabeth's marital status was a 
2 CONT political concern because there was no English heir to the throne. 
2 CONT Parliament insistently petitioned her to marry, but she replied with the 
2 CONT statement that she intended to live and die a virgin, and she became known 
2 CONT as the Virgin Queen. Her statement did not prevent her from toying 
2 CONT constantly with the idea of marriage. She was besieged by royal suitors, 
2 CONT each of whom she favored when it was in her political interest to do so. 
2 CONT Her affections, however, were bestowed on a succession of favorites, 
2 CONT notably Robert Dudley, 1st earl of Leicester, Sir Walter Raleigh, and 
2 CONT Robert Devereux, 2d earl of Essex. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Elizabeth's most delicate political problem was that involving her Roman 
2 CONT Catholic cousin, Mary, queen of Scots. Mary sought refuge in England after 
2 CONT being defeated in battle by her half brother, James Stuart, earl of Moray 
2 CONT (1531?-70). Elizabeth immediately imprisoned Mary because the Catholic 
2 CONT monarchs of Europe and her own Catholic subjects considered Elizabeth 
2 CONT illegitimate. By their reasoning, Mary was the lawful queen of England. 
2 CONT Thus, to Elizabeth, Mary was the potential center of conspiracy. Mary was 
2 CONT kept captive for years, giving rise to many plots by English Catholics for 
2 CONT her release. When in 1586 Walsingham, then secretary of state, discovered 
2 CONT a plot to assassinate Elizabeth and place Mary on the throne of England, 
2 CONT Elizabeth reluctantly agreed to have Mary executed in 1587. The execution 
2 CONT had serious results. Philip II of Spain had, for years, been troubled by 
2 CONT the raids of English mariners on his colonial possessions. Because both 
2 CONT Mary and Philip were Catholic, her death provided him with an added 
2 CONT stimulus to prosecute the war with England that had been going on since 
2 CONT 1585; he therefore sent a fleet to invade the country in 1588. The Spanish 
2 CONT Armada, however, suffered an inglorious defeat, and England eventually 
2 CONT took the place of Spain as the great colonizer of the New World and the 
2 CONT reigning power on the seas. Moreover, by inflicting such defeat on 
2 CONT Catholic Spain, England established Protestantism as a force in 
2 CONT international politics. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT End of an Era
2 CONT 
2 CONT Elizabeth's popularity waned toward the end of her reign because of her 
2 CONT heavy expenditures and abuse of royal power. Moreover, her policies became 
2 CONT weaker, her later ministers being less able than Cecil or Walsingham. The 
2 CONT close of Elizabeth's reign was disturbed by a revolt in Ireland that was 
2 CONT led by Hugh O'Neill. The 2d earl of Essex, Elizabeth's favorite, 
2 CONT unsuccessfully led an army against the Irish. When he returned to England, 
2 CONT he led a revolt against the queen and was executed in 1601. Following his 
2 CONT death, Elizabeth was disconsolate. She spent the last years of her life 
2 CONT unhappy and alone, having outlived a glorious age, the beginning of the 
2 CONT history of what would become modern England.
2 CONT   
2 CONT In addition to being a time of political triumphs, the Elizabethan era was 
2 CONT notable as one of the greatest periods of English literature. Edmund 
2 CONT Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, and Shakespeare were only a few of the host 
2 CONT of writers who created their great works under Elizabeth. The dramatic 
2 CONT personality of Elizabeth became the subject of a voluminous literature.

1 NOTE He was the last king in the male line of the house of Tudor. He succeeded 
2 CONT to the throne on the death of his father early in 1547. On his accession, 
2 CONT his maternal uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st earl of Hertford, was named Lord 
2 CONT Protector and duke of Somerset. In 1547 the Protector, in Edward's name, 
2 CONT invaded Scotland, using as a pretext an alleged violation by the Scots of 
2 CONT an agreement to give Mary, queen of Scots, in marriage to Edward. The 
2 CONT English forces defeated the Scots at Pinkie in September of that year. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Both Edward and the Protector strongly favored the principle of the 
2 CONT Reformation and did much to establish Protestantism in England. The body 
2 CONT of edicts known as the Six Articles, enacted in the reign of Henry VIII, 
2 CONT was repealed, and a new service book, the first Book of Common Prayer, was 
2 CONT imposed in 1549. Although it was moderate in its approach, it was strongly 
2 CONT opposed by Roman Catholics and stirred some uprisings. It subsequently, 
2 CONT however, came into general use in the Anglican church. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1549 Somerset's attempt to help poor peasants by forbidding enclosure 
2 CONT was thwarted by rich landowners, with the result that the peasants 
2 CONT revolted. The opportunity was used by John Dudley, later duke of 
2 CONT Northumberland, to remove Somerset from power. Edward was thereafter 
2 CONT virtually controlled by Dudley, who in 1552 persuaded him to have Somerset 
2 CONT executed for treason. The king became seriously ill of tuberculosis the 
2 CONT year after. Shortly before Edward's death, Dudley induced him to sign a 
2 CONT will depriving his half sisters, who later ruled as Mary I and Elizabeth 
2 CONT I, of their claim to the royal succession. The right of succession then 
2 CONT fell to Lady Jane Grey, who had married Dudley's son, but she was deposed 
2 CONT by Mary a few days later.

2 CONT as Ferdinand II he was also king of Sicily (1468-1516) and of Aragón 
2 CONT (1479-1516); as Ferdinand III, king of Naples (1504-16). He was the son of 
2 CONT King John II of Aragón. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The union of the Spanish kingdoms of Aragón and Castile was effected in 
2 CONT 1469 by Ferdinand's marriage to his cousin Isabella I, queen of Castile. 
2 CONT Ferdinand had hoped by this alliance to obtain the Castilian crown for 
2 CONT himself, but his high-spirited and politically astute wife firmly retained 
2 CONT sovereign authority in her own realm. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The political philosophies of the two rulers were almost identical, 
2 CONT however, and their reign was inaugurated with the promulgation of 
2 CONT energetic and sweeping measures designed to strengthen the royal authority 
2 CONT and to curb the power of the nobles, who had usurped many privileges and 
2 CONT functions of the Crown. To this end, Ferdinand organized (1476) the Santa 
2 CONT Hermandad, or Holy Brotherhood, a kind of national military police. 
2 CONT Insistence on religious conformity was one of their basic policies. In 
2 CONT 1478 a bull issued by Pope Sixtus IV empowered the king and queen to 
2 CONT appoint three inquisitors to deal with heretics and other offenders 
2 CONT against the church; this marked the beginning of the Spanish Inquisition. 
2 CONT Although founded to further religious ends, the Inquisition in Spain 
2 CONT became a political instrument of the absolute monarchy, further abridging 
2 CONT the power of the nobles. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The year 1492 was the most notable of Ferdinand's reign. It opened with 
2 CONT the conquest of Granada, which marked the victorious conclusion of the 
2 CONT long struggle against the Moors. In August Christopher Columbus, sponsored 
2 CONT by Ferdinand and Isabella, set sail from the small Spanish seaport of 
2 CONT Palos on his epoch-making voyage to America, which was the first step in 
2 CONT the creation of the Spanish overseas colonial empire. In 1493, by the 
2 CONT terms of a treaty between Spain and France, Ferdinand recovered from King 
2 CONT Charles VIII of France the ancient province of Roussillon (now forming the 
2 CONT French department of Pyrénées-Orientales), which Ferdinand's father had 
2 CONT mortgaged to King Louis XI of France. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Because his daughter Joanna the Mad (1479-1555) became insane after the 
2 CONT death of Isabella, Ferdinand assumed the regency of Castile in 1506. He 
2 CONT joined the League of Cambrai against the republic of Venice in 1508, and 
2 CONT conquered Oran and Tripoli on the North African coast in 1509. He annexed 
2 CONT the kingdom of Navarre in 1512, thereby extending the borders of Spain 
2 CONT from the Pyrenees Mountains to the Rock of Gibraltar. Ferdinand was in 
2 CONT many ways a competent ruler. His reign, however, was characterized by an 
2 CONT insatiable thirst for power, and he was both cruel and perfidious. He was 
2 CONT succeeded by his grandson Charles (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V).

1 NOTE Henry the Lion (circa 1129-95), duke of Saxony (1139-80) and duke of 
2 CONT Bavaria (1156-80), a powerful German prince, who became a rival of the 
2 CONT Holy Roman emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The only son of Henry the Proud, duke of Bavaria and Saxony (1108-39), 
2 CONT Henry was probably born in Ravensburg. At the age of ten he succeeded his 
2 CONT father to the duchy of Saxony, which his mother and grandmother 
2 CONT administered for him until 1146. In 1147 Henry demanded that the Diet of 
2 CONT Frankfort restore to him the duchy of Bavaria, which had been taken from 
2 CONT his father. When refused, Henry began an unsuccessful war against Holy 
2 CONT Roman Emperor Conrad III. After Conrad's death, however, Henry's duchy was 
2 CONT restored to him by the imperial successor, Frederick Barbarossa. Henry 
2 CONT subsequently aided Frederick in wars in Poland and Italy between 1157 and 
2 CONT 1159. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Possessing both German and Italian territories, Henry was a formidable 
2 CONT figure within the Holy Roman Empire. To curb him, a league of nobles and 
2 CONT prelates was formed in 1166; after two years of war, Henry was triumphant. 
2 CONT In 1168 he took as his second wife Matilda (1156-89), the daughter of 
2 CONT Henry II, king of England. In 1172-73 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT By refusing to aid Frederick I in an Italian expedition, Henry instigated 
2 CONT a quarrel (1175-76) between himself and the emperor. As a result, he was 
2 CONT placed under the ban of the empire. He was deprived of most of his 
2 CONT possessions in 1180 and twice forced into exile, in 1182 and 1189, 
2 CONT spending most of his time in England. When he returned to Germany shortly 
2 CONT after the second exile, Henry took part in a rebellion of German nobles 
2 CONT against Frederick's successor, Emperor Henry VI. He made peace with the 
2 CONT emperor, however, at Fulda in 1190. Henry was a capable ruler, one of his 
2 CONT greatest accomplishments being the colonization of previously Slavic 
2 CONT territories east of the Elbe River. He died at Brunswick, August 6, 1195.

1 NOTE His name in Latin is Carolus Magnus (Charles the Great), who led his 
2 CONT Frankish armies to victory over numerous other peoples and established his 
2 CONT rule in most of western and central Europe. He was the best-known and most 
2 CONT influential king in Europe in the Middle Ages. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Years
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 751 Pepin the Short dethroned the last Merovingian king and assumed the 
2 CONT royal title himself. He was crowned by Pope Stephen II in 754. Besides 
2 CONT anointing Pepin, Pope Stephen anointed both Charlemagne and his younger 
2 CONT brother Carloman. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Within the year Pepin invaded Italy to protect the pope against the 
2 CONT Lombards, and in 756 he again had to rush to the pope's aid. From 760 on, 
2 CONT Pepin's main military efforts went into the conquest of Aquitaine, the 
2 CONT lands south of the Loire River. Charlemagne accompanied his father on most 
2 CONT of these expeditions. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Campaigns
2 CONT 
2 CONT When Pepin died in 768, the rule of his realms was to be shared between 
2 CONT his two sons. Charlemagne sought an alliance with the Lombards by marrying 
2 CONT the daughter of their king, Desiderius (reigned 757-74). In 771 Carloman 
2 CONT died suddenly. Charlemagne then seized his territories, but Carloman's 
2 CONT heirs took refuge at the court of Desiderius. By that time Charlemagne had 
2 CONT repudiated his wife, and Desiderius was no longer friendly. In 772, when 
2 CONT Pope Adrian I appealed to Charlemagne for help against Desiderius, the 
2 CONT Frankish king invaded Italy, deposed his erstwhile father-in-law (774), 
2 CONT and himself assumed the royal title. He then journeyed to Rome and 
2 CONT reaffirmed his father's promise to protect papal lands. As early as 772 
2 CONT Charlemagne had fought onslaughts of the heathen Saxons on his lands. 
2 CONT Buoyed by his Italian success, he now (775) embarked on a campaign to 
2 CONT conquer and Christianize them. That campaign had some initial success but 
2 CONT was to drag on for 30 years, in which time he conducted many other 
2 CONT campaigns as well. He fought in Spain in 778; on the return trip his rear 
2 CONT guard, led by Roland, was ambushed, a story immortalized in The Song of 
2 CONT Roland. In 788 he subjected the Bavarians to his rule, and between 791 and 
2 CONT 796 Charlemagne's armies conquered the empire of the Avars (corresponding 
2 CONT roughly to modern Hungary and Austria). 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Coronation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Having thus established Frankish rule over so many other peoples, 
2 CONT Charlemagne had in fact built an empire and become an emperor. It remained 
2 CONT only for him to add the title. On Christmas Day, in 800, Charlemagne knelt 
2 CONT to pray in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. Pope Leo III then placed a 
2 CONT crown upon his head, and the people assembled in the church acclaimed him 
2 CONT the great, pacific emperor of the Romans. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charlemagne's biographer, Einhard, reported that the king was surprised by 
2 CONT this coronation and that had he known it was going to happen, he would not 
2 CONT have gone into the church that day. This report has led to much 
2 CONT speculation by historians. Charlemagne probably desired and expected to 
2 CONT get the imperial title and he subsequently used it. In 813 he designated 
2 CONT his sole surviving son, Louis, as his successor, and personally crowned 
2 CONT him. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Administration
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charlemagne established a more permanent royal capital than had any of his 
2 CONT predecessors. His favorite residence from 794 on was at Aix-la-Chapelle. 
2 CONT He had a church and a palace constructed there, based in part on 
2 CONT architectural borrowings from Ravenna and Rome. At his court he gathered 
2 CONT scholars from all over Europe, the most famous being the English cleric 
2 CONT Alcuin of York, whom he placed in charge of the palace school. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Administration of the empire was entrusted to some 250 royal 
2 CONT administrators called counts. Charlemagne issued hundreds of decrees, 
2 CONT called capitularies, dealing with a broad range of topics from judicial 
2 CONT and military matters to monasteries, education, and the management of 
2 CONT royal estates. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The empire did not expand after 800; indeed, already in the 790s the 
2 CONT seacoasts and river valleys experienced the first, dreaded visits of the 
2 CONT Vikings. Charlemagne ordered a special watch against them in every harbor, 
2 CONT but with little effect. He died before their full, destructive force was 
2 CONT unleashed on the empire. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Evaluation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charlemagne is important not only for the number of his victories and the 
2 CONT size of his empire, but for the special blend of tradition and innovation 
2 CONT that he represented. On the one hand, he was a traditional Germanic 
2 CONT warrior, who spent most of his adult life fighting. In the Saxon campaigns 
2 CONT he imposed baptism by the sword, and he retaliated against rebels with 
2 CONT merciless slaughter. On the other hand, he placed his immense power and 
2 CONT prestige at the service of Christian doctrine, the monastic life, the 
2 CONT teaching of Latin, the copying of books, and the rule of law. His life, 
2 CONT held up as a model to most later kings, thus embodied the fusion of 
2 CONT Germanic, Roman, and Christian cultures that became the basis of European 
2 CONT civilization.

2 CONT Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany. He was the fourth son of Holy Roman Emperor 
2 CONT Louis I; his mother, Louis's second wife, was Judith of Bavaria. Judith's 
2 CONT determination to secure a kingdom for her only son led to civil war with 
2 CONT Louis's other two surviving sons, Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I and King 
2 CONT Louis II of Germany. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of 
2 CONT Verdun in 843. Charles received the western portion of the empire, which 
2 CONT from this time may be called the kingdom of France, or the West Frankish 
2 CONT Kingdom. Charles was a weak ruler; the great nobles were rapidly becoming 
2 CONT independent, and the Vikings pillaged the country without meeting much 
2 CONT resistance from Charles, who preferred to buy them off. Nevertheless, when 
2 CONT Holy Roman Emperor Louis II died in 875, Charles received the imperial 
2 CONT crown through the favor of Pope John VIII. Charles was succeeded as king

1 NOTE He was a Habsburg king of Spain, who ruled the country at the height of 
2 CONT its power and influence and used that power in the service of the Roman 
2 CONT Catholic church and the Counter Reformation. During his reign the 
2 CONT Philippine Islands (named for him) were conquered and colonies were 
2 CONT established in what is now the southern United States. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He was educated by Roman Catholic clergymen, whose influence shaped his 
2 CONT policies as king. Before succeeding to the throne of Spain upon his 
2 CONT father's abdication in 1556, Philip had already received the duchy of 
2 CONT Milan (1540), the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily (1554), and the 
2 CONT Netherlands (1555) from his father. With the throne of Spain he also 
2 CONT inherited extensive regions of the New World. Shortly after Philip's 
2 CONT accession, the Spanish forces were victorious over the French at the 
2 CONT battles of Saint-Quentin (1557) and Gravelines (1558), and the 60-year war 
2 CONT with France was concluded by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis (1559), which 
2 CONT was highly favorable to Spain. An outgrowth of the peace was Philip's 
2 CONT third marriage to Princess Elizabeth of France, who had been betrothed to 
2 CONT his son, Don Carlos.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In the Netherlands Philip banned Protestantism and severely restricted the 
2 CONT rights of the people. He used the Inquisition as a method of control, and 
2 CONT thousands of Protestants were killed or exiled. In 1567 the Protestants 
2 CONT revolted, and Philip sent an army to suppress them, thus beginning 80 
2 CONT years of war by which the northern provinces (now the Netherlands) won 
2 CONT their independence. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In Spain Philip's oppression of the Moriscos (Christianized Muslims) 
2 CONT provoked them to rebel in 1568; after suppressing the revolt in 1571, 
2 CONT Philip exiled almost the entire group to the great detriment of the 
2 CONT country. In 1571 Philip sent his half brother John of Austria on a naval 
2 CONT expedition that destroyed the Ottoman navy at the Battle of Lepanto. 
2 CONT Asserting his claim to the throne of Portugal Philip conquered that 
2 CONT country in 1580. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT His desire to return the English to Catholicism as well as to check their 
2 CONT rival maritime power, led Philip to the decision to invade England, and to 
2 CONT that end he ordered the construction of a great fleet. In 1588 he 
2 CONT dispatched the Armada to the British Isles, where it was destroyed by bad 
2 CONT weather and the English. From 1590 to 1598 Philip was again at war with 
2 CONT France, aiding the Catholic forces of the Holy League in its war against 
2 CONT the Huguenot Henry IV. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1563 Philip began the construction of El Escorial, a somber monastic 
2 CONT palace outside Madrid, which ranks among Europe's finest architectural 
2 CONT monuments. Completed in 1584, it became his second residence.

1 NOTE Also Mary Stuart.  Mary became queen before she was a week old. In 1558 
2 CONT she was married to the Dauphin of France, who succeeded to the French 
2 CONT throne as Francis II in 1559 but died the following year. Mary returned to 
2 CONT Scotland in 1561. Although Roman Catholic, she surrounded herself at first 
2 CONT with Protestant advisers, her chief minister being her half brother James 
2 CONT Stuart, whom she soon afterward created earl of Moray. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Mary's marriage in 1565 to her cousin, the Catholic Scottish nobleman 
2 CONT Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was performed with Roman Catholic rites. The 
2 CONT marriage aroused Protestant feelings and was the signal for an 
2 CONT insurrection by Moray and a Scottish noble family who hoped to be joined 
2 CONT by the whole Protestant party. Their hope was disappointed, however, and 
2 CONT the queen, taking the field in person, at once quelled the revolt. Her 
2 CONT triumph was scarcely over when misunderstandings began to arise between 
2 CONT her and Darnley. She had given him the title of king, but he now demanded 
2 CONT that the crown be secured to him for life and that, if the queen died 
2 CONT without children, it should descend to his heirs. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Before Moray's rebellion Mary's chief minister had been David Rizzio 
2 CONT (circa 1533-66), a court favorite and a Roman Catholic. The king was now 
2 CONT persuaded that Rizzio was the obstacle to his designs upon the crown. 
2 CONT Acting on this belief, he entered into a formal compact with Moray; Lord 
2 CONT Patrick Ruthven (1520?-66); James Douglas, 4th earl of Morton (1525-81); 
2 CONT and other leaders of the Protestant party. The result of this conspiracy 
2 CONT was the murder of Rizzio in 1566. Early in 1567 the house in which Darnley 
2 CONT lay sick was blown up by gunpowder, probably at the instigation of the 
2 CONT Scottish nobleman James Hepburn, 4th earl of Bothwell, who, since Moray's 
2 CONT revolt and still more since Rizzio's murder, had been favored by the 
2 CONT queen. Darnley was discovered strangled close by the scene of the 
2 CONT explosion. It was suspected that Mary herself was not wholly ignorant of 
2 CONT the plot. Evidence substantiating this theory is reflected in 
2 CONT incriminating letters and sonnets, allegedly written by Mary to Bothwell 
2 CONT and found later that year in a silver casket. Bothwell was brought to a 
2 CONT mock trial and acquitted; soon afterward he divorced his wife and married 
2 CONT Mary in a Protestant ceremony. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT This step at once turned the Scottish nobles against Mary. She was able to 
2 CONT lead an army against them, and although it was equal in number to the 
2 CONT confederate army, it was visibly inferior in discipline. On June 15, 1567, 
2 CONT Mary's forces were defeated at Carberry Hill and she was forced to abandon 
2 CONT Bothwell and surrender herself to the confederate lords. On July 24, at 
2 CONT Lochleven, she was prevailed upon to sign an act of abdication in favor of 
2 CONT her son, who was crowned as James VI five days afterward at Stirling. 
2 CONT Escaping from her island-prison at Lochleven on May 2, 1568, she was able 
2 CONT within a few days to assemble an army of 6000 men. On May 12 her army was 
2 CONT defeated by the regent Moray at Langside, near Glasgow. Four days 
2 CONT afterward, in spite of the entreaties of her best friends, Mary crossed 
2 CONT Solway Firth and sought refuge at the court of Elizabeth I, queen of 
2 CONT England, only to find herself a prisoner of Elizabeth for life. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Of the ensuing intrigues to effect her deliverance and to place her on the 
2 CONT throne of Elizabeth, the most famous was that of Mary's page, Anthony 
2 CONT Babington, who plotted to assassinate Elizabeth. The conspiracy was 
2 CONT discovered, and Mary was brought to trial in October 1586. She was 
2 CONT sentenced to death on October 25, but not until February 1, 1587, did 
2 CONT Elizabeth sign the warrant of execution, which was carried out a week 
2 CONT later.

1 NOTE James I (of England) (1566-1625), king of England (1603-25) and, as James 
2 CONT VI, king of Scotland (1567-1625). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Born on June 19, 1566, in Edinburgh Castle, Scotland, James was the only 
2 CONT son of Mary, queen of Scots, and her second husband, Lord Darnley. On the 
2 CONT abdication of his mother in 1567, he was proclaimed king of Scotland. A 
2 CONT succession of regents ruled the kingdom until 1576, when James became 
2 CONT nominal ruler. The boy king was little more than a puppet in the hands of 
2 CONT political intriguers until 1581. In that year, with the aid of his 
2 CONT favorites, James Stuart, earl of Arran (died 1596), and Esmé Stuart, duke 
2 CONT of Lennox (1542?-83), James assumed actual rule of Scotland. Scotland was 
2 CONT at that time divided domestically by religious conflict between the 
2 CONT Protestants and Roman Catholics, and in foreign affairs by those favoring 
2 CONT an alliance with France and those supporting England. In 1582 James was 
2 CONT kidnapped by a group of Protestant nobles headed by William Ruthven, earl 
2 CONT of Gowrie (1541?-84), and was held virtual prisoner until he escaped the 
2 CONT following year. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1586, by the Treaty of Berwick, James formed an alliance with his 
2 CONT cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England, and the following year, after the 
2 CONT execution of his mother, he succeeded in reducing the power of the great 
2 CONT Roman Catholic nobles. His marriage to Anne of Denmark (1574-1619) in 1589 
2 CONT brought him for a time into close relationship with the Protestants. After 
2 CONT the Gowrie conspiracy of 1600, James repressed the Protestants as strongly 
2 CONT as he had the Catholics. He replaced the feudal power of the nobility with 
2 CONT a strong central government, and maintaining the divine right of kings, he 
2 CONT enforced the superiority of the state over the church. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1603 Queen Elizabeth died childless, and James succeeded her as James 
2 CONT I, the first Stuart king of England. In 1604 he ended England's war with 
2 CONT Spain, but his tactless attitude toward Parliament, based on his belief in 
2 CONT divine right, led to prolonged conflict with that body. James convoked the 
2 CONT Hampton Court Conference (1604), at which he authorized a new translation 
2 CONT of the Bible, generally called the King James Version. His undue severity 
2 CONT toward Roman Catholics, however, led to the abortive Gunpowder Plot in 
2 CONT 1605. James tried unsuccessfully to advance the cause of religious peace 
2 CONT in Europe, giving his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to the elector of the 
2 CONT Palatinate, Frederick V (1596-1632), the leader of the German Protestants. 
2 CONT He also sought to end the conflict by attempting to arrange a marriage 
2 CONT between his son, Charles, and the infanta of Spain, then the principal 
2 CONT Catholic power. When he was rebuffed, he formed an alliance with France 
2 CONT and declared war on Spain, thus contributing to the flames he had tried to 
2 CONT quench. James I died at the Theobalds in Hertfordshire on March 27, 1625, 
2 CONT and was succeeded to the throne by his son, Charles I.

2 CONT VII, who continued his father's work of restoring unity and stability to 
2 CONT France after the ravages of the Hundred Years' War. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Louis was born in Bourges on July 3, 1423. After joining with discontented 
2 CONT nobles in an unsuccessful rebellion against Charles VII in 1440, he was 
2 CONT pardoned and made governor of Dauphiné, where he showed great 
2 CONT administrative ability. After the death of his first wife, Margaret of 
2 CONT Scotland (1425?-45), Louis defied his father by marrying (1447) Charlotte 
2 CONT of Savoy. From 1456 to 1461 he lived at the court of Philip the Good, duke 
2 CONT of Burgundy. Louis was known as The Spider because of his ugliness and the 
2 CONT skill with which he maneuvered against his enemies. After he became king, 
2 CONT his greatest antagonist was Charles the Bold, Philip's successor as duke 
2 CONT of Burgundy. Charles was influential in forming a conspiracy of nobles 
2 CONT called the League of the Public Weal, against Louis in 1465. In his 
2 CONT efforts to curb the powers of the great French nobles, Louis relied on the 
2 CONT support of the lower nobility and the middle class. After Charles the 
2 CONT Bold's defeat and death in 1477, Louis continued the war against Charles's 
2 CONT daughter, Mary of Burgundy (1457-82). He added Anjou, Maine, Provence, and 
2 CONT other regions to his kingdom in 1480-81; in 1482 he divided the Burgundian 
2 CONT territories with Mary's husband, Maximilian of Habsburg (later Holy Roman 
2 CONT Emperor Maximilian I). During most of his despotic reign Louis 
2 CONT relentlessly consolidated the royal power, employing bribery, diplomacy, 
2 CONT intrigue, treachery, and, occasionally, war. By consolidating his power, 
2 CONT he laid the foundation for the absolute monarchy in France, and by 
2 CONT promoting industry and commerce he increased the country's wealth. He died 
2 CONT at Plessis-les-Tours on August 30, 1483, and was succeeded by his son

1 NOTE Charles I (of England) (1600-49), king of England, Scotland, and Ireland 
2 CONT (1625-49), who was deposed and executed during the English Revolution. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charles was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, on November 19, 1600. The 
2 CONT second son of James I, Charles became heir apparent when his elder 
2 CONT brother, Henry (1594-1612), died, and was made prince of Wales in 1616. In 
2 CONT 1623, during the Thirty Years' War, Charles visited Spain to negotiate his 
2 CONT proposed marriage with the Spanish infanta. The proposal had been made in 
2 CONT order to effect an alliance between Spain and England. When it became 
2 CONT apparent, however, that the Spanish had no intention of concluding such an 
2 CONT alliance, negotiations were begun for his marriage to the French princess 
2 CONT Henrietta Maria, and England formed an alliance with France against Spain. 
2 CONT In 1625 Charles succeeded to the throne and married Henrietta Maria, but 
2 CONT his marriage aroused the ill will of his Protestant subjects because the 
2 CONT queen consort was Roman Catholic. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Charles believed in the divine right of kings and in the authority of the 
2 CONT Church of England. These beliefs soon brought him into conflict with 
2 CONT Parliament and ultimately led to civil war. He came under the influence of 
2 CONT his close friend George Villiers, 1st duke of Buckingham, whom he 
2 CONT appointed his chief minister in defiance of public opinion and whose war 
2 CONT schemes ended ignominiously. Three Parliaments, convoked in four years, 
2 CONT were dissolved by Charles because of their refusal to comply with his 
2 CONT arbitrary measures. When the third Parliament met in 1628, it presented 
2 CONT the Petition of Right, a statement demanding that Charles make certain 
2 CONT reforms in exchange for war funds. Charles was forced to accept the 
2 CONT petition. In 1629, although the assassination of Buckingham had removed a 
2 CONT parliamentary grievance, Charles dismissed Parliament and had several 
2 CONT parliamentary leaders imprisoned. Charles governed without a Parliament 
2 CONT for the next 11 years. During this time forced loans, poundage, tonnage, 
2 CONT ship money, and other extraordinary financial measures were sanctioned to 
2 CONT meet governmental expenses. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1637 Charles's attempt to impose the Anglican liturgy in Scotland led 
2 CONT to rioting by Presbyterian Scots. Charles was unable to quell the revolt, 
2 CONT and in 1640 he convoked the so-called Short Parliament to raise an army 
2 CONT and necessary funds. This body, which sat for one month (April-May), 
2 CONT refused his demands, drew up a statement of public grievances, and 
2 CONT insisted on peace with Scotland. Obtaining money by irregular means, 
2 CONT Charles advanced against the Scots, who crossed the border, routed his 
2 CONT army at Newburn, and soon afterward occupied Newcastle and Durham. His 
2 CONT money exhausted, the king was compelled to call his fifth Parliament, the 
2 CONT Long Parliament, in 1640. Led by John Pym, it proceeded against the two 
2 CONT chief royal advisers and secured the imprisonment and subsequent 
2 CONT executions of the archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, and Sir Thomas 
2 CONT Wentworth, 1st earl of Strafford. In 1641 Charles agreed to bills 
2 CONT abolishing the prerogative courts, prohibiting arbitrary taxation, and 
2 CONT ensuring that this Parliament would not be dissolved without its own 
2 CONT permission. The king also agreed to more religious liberties for the 
2 CONT Scots. Soon after, Charles was implicated in a plot to murder the 
2 CONT Covenanter leaders, including Archibald Campbell, 8th earl of Argyll. When 
2 CONT Charles visited Scotland in August 1641, he promised Campbell that he 
2 CONT would submit to the demands of the Scottish Parliament. While still in 
2 CONT Scotland, the king received word of a rebellion in Ireland in which 
2 CONT thousands of English colonists were massacred. When he returned to London 
2 CONT in November, he tried to have Parliament raise an army, under his control, 
2 CONT to put down the Irish revolt. Parliament, fearing that the army would be 
2 CONT used against itself, refused, and issued the Grand Remonstrance, a list of 
2 CONT reform demands, including the right of Parliament to approve the king's 
2 CONT ministers. Charles appeared in the House of Commons with an armed force 
2 CONT and tried to arrest Pym and four members. The country was aroused, and the 
2 CONT king fled with his family from London. Both sides then raised armies. The 
2 CONT supporters of Parliament were called Roundheads, and those of the king, 
2 CONT Cavaliers. The first civil war of the English Revolution, now inevitable, 
2 CONT began at Edgehill on October 23, 1642. The Cavaliers were initially 
2 CONT successful, but after a series of reverses Charles gave himself up to the 
2 CONT Scottish army on May 5, 1646. Having refused to accept Presbyterianism, he 
2 CONT was delivered (June 1647) to the English Parliament. Later he escaped to 
2 CONT the Isle of Wight but was imprisoned there. By this time a serious 
2 CONT division had occurred between Parliament and the army. Oliver Cromwell and 
2 CONT his supporters, the Independents, compelled Parliament to pass an act of 
2 CONT treason against further negotiation with the king. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Eventually, the moderate Parliamentarians were forcibly ejected by the 
2 CONT Independents, and the remaining legislators, who formed the so-called Rump 
2 CONT Parliament, appointed a court to try the king. On January 20, 1649, the 
2 CONT trial began in Westminster Hall. Charles denied the legality of the court 
2 CONT and refused to plead. On January 27 he was sentenced to death as a tyrant, 
2 CONT murderer, and enemy of the nation. Scotland protested, the royal family 
2 CONT entreated, and France and the Netherlands interceded, in vain. He was 
2 CONT beheaded at Whitehall, London, on January 30, 1649. Subsequently Oliver 
2 CONT Cromwell became chairman of the council of state, a parliamentary agency 
2 CONT that governed England as a republic.

1 NOTE Charles II (of England) (1630-85), king of England, Scotland, and Ireland 
2 CONT (1660-85), whose reign marked a period of relative stability after the 
2 CONT upheaval of the English Revolution. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charles was born in London on May 29, 1630. He was the second, but eldest 
2 CONT surviving, son of King Charles I and was prince of Wales from birth. He 
2 CONT took his seat in the House of Lords in 1641 and held a nominal military 
2 CONT command in the early campaigns of the first civil war of the English 
2 CONT Revolution. He later fled from England and went into exile at The Hague, 
2 CONT the Netherlands, from where he made two attempts to save his father. On 
2 CONT the execution of Charles I in 1649, Charles II assumed the title of king 
2 CONT and was so proclaimed in Scotland and sections of Ireland, and in England, 
2 CONT then ruled by Oliver Cromwell. After an acknowledgment of the faults of 
2 CONT his father, Charles accepted the Scottish crown on January 1, 1651, at 
2 CONT Scone from the Scottish noble Archibald Campbell, 8th earl of Argyll. He 
2 CONT invaded England the following August with 10,000 men and was proclaimed 
2 CONT king at Carlisle and other places along his route. His army, however, was 
2 CONT routed by Cromwell at Worcester on September 3, 1651. After this battle 
2 CONT Charles fled to France. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT He spent eight years in poverty and dissipation while in exile on the 
2 CONT Continent. In 1658, following the death of Cromwell and the succession of 
2 CONT his son, Richard, as Lord Protector, the demand for the restoration of 
2 CONT royalty increased. In February 1660, General George Monck led an army into 
2 CONT London and forced the Rump Parliament to dissolve. In April, in the 
2 CONT Declaration of Breda, Charles announced his intention to accept a 
2 CONT parliamentary government and to grant amnesty to his political opponents. 
2 CONT A new Parliament requested Charles to return and proclaimed him king on 
2 CONT May 8, 1660. He landed at Dover on May 26 and was welcomed at Whitehall by 
2 CONT Parliament three days later. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Charles was crowned on April 23, 1661. Noted for subservience and 
2 CONT insistence on royal prerogative, his first Parliament was overwhelmingly 
2 CONT Royalist and gave him free rein. Edward Hyde, 1st earl of Clarendon, his 
2 CONT companion in exile, was appointed chief minister. Clarendon restored the 
2 CONT supremacy of the Church of England, and English and Scottish 
2 CONT Nonconformists and Presbyterians were persecuted contrary to the 
2 CONT Declaration of Breda. Extravagant and always in want of money, Charles 
2 CONT assented to the abolition of the feudal rights of knight service, 
2 CONT wardship, and purveyance in consideration of a large annuity that, 
2 CONT however, was never fully paid. On May 20, 1662, he married the Portuguese 
2 CONT princess Catherine of Braganza (1638-1705) for her large dowry. The 
2 CONT failure of Parliament to produce the amount agreed on and the chronic 
2 CONT mismanagement of the English finances brought the king to a desperate need 
2 CONT of money. In return for subsidies from Louis XIV of France, Charles formed 
2 CONT a secret alliance with that country; in 1672 that alliance plunged England 
2 CONT into a war with the Netherlands. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The war was popular. Commercial and colonial rivalry had already brought 
2 CONT about two wars between the two countries, the last one occurring between 
2 CONT 1665 and 1667. The Dutch War of 1672 resulted in the English acquisition 
2 CONT of the Dutch colony of New Netherland (now New York). Knowledge of his 
2 CONT negotiations with France, together with his efforts to become an absolute 
2 CONT ruler, brought Charles into conflict with Parliament, which, buoyed by 
2 CONT French subsidies, he dissolved in 1681. The struggle was heightened by 
2 CONT enactment of the anti-Catholic Test Acts and by the so-called popish plot 
2 CONT fabricated by Titus Oates. From 1681 until his death on February 6, 1685, 
2 CONT Charles ruled without Parliament. Although a member of the Anglican 
2 CONT church, Charles received the last rites of the Roman Catholic church. He 
2 CONT was succeeded by his brother James II.

1 NOTE James II (of Great Britain) (1633-1701), king of England, Scotland, and 
2 CONT Ireland (1685-88). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT James was born on October 14, 1633, in London, the second surviving son of 
2 CONT King Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria. He was created duke of 
2 CONT York and Albany in 1634. After the execution of his father, he was taken 
2 CONT to the Continent, and in 1657 he entered the Spanish service in the war 
2 CONT against England. At the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, his brother 
2 CONT became king as Charles II, and James was made lord high admiral of 
2 CONT England. In the same year he married Anne Hyde (1637-71), daughter of 
2 CONT Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon. In 1672 James made a public profession of 
2 CONT his conversion to the Roman Catholic faith. The following year the English 
2 CONT Parliament passed the first of the Test Acts disqualifying Catholics from 
2 CONT holding office, and James resigned as lord high admiral. Shortly after, he 
2 CONT married Mary Beatrice of Modena (1658-1718), a Roman Catholic. In 1679 the 
2 CONT House of Commons unsuccessfully attempted to bar James from the throne. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT On the death of Charles in 1685, James became king. In the same year he 
2 CONT crushed a revolt in England by his nephew, James Scott, duke of Monmouth, 
2 CONT and another in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell, earl of Argyll. James 
2 CONT alienated many supporters by his severe reprisals, especially by a series

1 NOTE He was frequently called James Edward Stuart.  He was a pretender to the 
2 CONT throne, also called James III, the Old Pretender, and the Chevalier de 
2 CONT Saint George; for more than half a century he was regarded by his Jacobite 
2 CONT followers as the rightful king of Great Britain. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT When his father, King James II, was driven from England by the so-called 
2 CONT Glorious Revolution later the same year, James Edward was taken to the 
2 CONT French court at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. In 1701, on the death of James II, 
2 CONT Louis XIV of France proclaimed the young prince the rightful successor to 
2 CONT the English throne. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT English sentiment was strongly against James Edward, however, because of 
2 CONT his Roman Catholicism. That same year the English Parliament, to prevent 
2 CONT the return of a Roman Catholic to the throne, passed the Act of 
2 CONT Settlement, and the following year it enacted a bill of attainder against 
2 CONT James Edward. In 1708, supported by the French and by a group of his 
2 CONT adherents known as Jacobites, James Edward attempted unsuccessfully to 
2 CONT invade Scotland and was driven back to France. In 1715 a rebellion was 
2 CONT launched by the Jacobites in Scotland and in December of that year James 
2 CONT Edward went to Scotland, where he was to be crowned. The movement failed, 
2 CONT however, in the face of superior forces under John Campbell, 2d duke of 
2 CONT Argyll, and James Edward again retired to France. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After 1719 James Edward lived in Rome, where he was given royal honors. 
2 CONT The struggle on behalf of the Stuart cause was renewed by his older son, 
2 CONT Charles Edward Stuart. James Edward's younger son, Henry Benedict Stuart, 
2 CONT Cardinal York, became the last of the Stuarts in the male line of 
2 CONT succession after his brother's death, and called himself Henry IX.

1 NOTE He was called William of Orange.  He was also a stadtholder of the 
2 CONT Netherlands (1672-1702), who helped form the Grand Alliance and led 
2 CONT England in its so-called Glorious Revolution. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1672, after the invasion of the Netherlands by the French king Louis 
2 CONT XIV, the leadership of Jan De Witt, grand pensionary of Holland, was 
2 CONT repudiated, and William was elected stadtholder, captain-general, and 
2 CONT admiral. William fought the French with great resolution, even cutting 
2 CONT (1673) dikes around Amsterdam to flood the surrounding countryside and 
2 CONT halt the advancing French armies. The Dutch suffered severe reverses in 
2 CONT subsequent battles. As a result of William's superior diplomacy, however, 
2 CONT which also included the strengthening of ties with England by his marriage 
2 CONT (1677) to the English princess Mary (eldest daughter of his uncle, James, 
2 CONT duke of York, later King James II), Louis XIV agreed to terminate the war 
2 CONT on terms favorable to the Dutch. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After the accession (1685) of James II there was fear in England that the 
2 CONT king's policies were directed toward restoring the power of the Roman 
2 CONT Catholic church. In July 1688, James's principal opponents secretly 
2 CONT invited William, who was Europe's leading Protestant statesman, to bring 
2 CONT an army of liberation to England. William and a force totaling about 
2 CONT 15,000 men landed at Torbay on November 5, 1688. Most of the English 
2 CONT nobility declared for William, and James fled to France. William accepted 
2 CONT the Declaration of Rights passed by the Convention Parliament, which met 
2 CONT on January 22, 1689, and on February 13, William and Mary were proclaimed 
2 CONT joint sovereigns of England. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Shortly after the conclusion of this Glorious Revolution, the Scottish 
2 CONT parliament accepted the new rulers. Predominantly Catholic Ireland, 
2 CONT however, remained loyal to the deposed king and had to be taken by force. 
2 CONT In 1690 William led the army that defeated James and his Irish partisans 
2 CONT at the Battle of the Boyne. William's reign continued to be marked by 
2 CONT abortive Jacobite plots to restore James to the throne. After the death of 
2 CONT Mary in 1694, William ruled alone. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1689, in pursuit of containing France, William had brought England into 
2 CONT the League of Augsburg, thereafter known as the Grand Alliance. For the 
2 CONT next eight years he was embroiled in wars on the Continent. He managed by 
2 CONT skillful diplomacy to hold the alliance together and, under the terms of 
2 CONT the Peace of Ryswick, Louis XIV of France surrendered (1697) much of the 
2 CONT territory he had won and recognized William as England's rightful king.
2 CONT   
2 CONT At home William manifested virtually none of the acumen he displayed in 
2 CONT foreign affairs. Although he was liberal in some things, it was not he but 
2 CONT Parliament, to which he was often opposed, that brought about the reforms 
2 CONT effected during his reign, such as the passing of the Bill of Rights, the 
2 CONT establishment of the Bank of England, the introduction of ministerial 
2 CONT responsibility in government, and the encouragement of a free press. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1701 William headed the second Grand Alliance, which became involved in 
2 CONT the so-called War of the Spanish Succession. He died before he could take 
2 CONT an active part in the struggle. His wife's sister, Queen Anne, succeeded 
2 CONT to the throne.

1 NOTE Anne (1665-1714), queen of Great Britain and Ireland (1702-14), the last 
2 CONT British sovereign of the house of Stuart. Born in London on February 6, 
2 CONT 1665, she was the second daughter of King James II. Her mother was James's 
2 CONT first wife, Anne Hyde (1637-71). In 1683 she was married to Prince George 
2 CONT of Denmark (1653-1708). Although her father converted to Roman Catholicism 
2 CONT in 1672, Anne remained Protestant and acquiesced in James's overthrow by 
2 CONT the anti-Roman Catholic Glorious Revolution of 1688, which brought her 
2 CONT sister Mary and Mary's husband, William of Orange, to the throne. Becoming 
2 CONT queen on William's death in 1702, Anne restored to favor John Churchill, 
2 CONT who had been disgraced by her predecessor, making him duke of Marlborough 
2 CONT and captain-general of the army. Marlborough won a series of victories 
2 CONT over the French in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14, known in 
2 CONT America as Queen Anne's War), and he and his wife, Sarah (1660-1744), had 
2 CONT great influence over the queen in the early years of her reign. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Devoted to the Church of England, Anne was inclined to favor the 
2 CONT pro-church Tory faction rather than its Whig opponents, but, influenced by 
2 CONT the Marlboroughs and Lord Treasurer Sidney Godolphin, earl of Godolphin 
2 CONT (1645-1712), she at first excluded the Tories from office. Later, however, 
2 CONT her friendship with the Marlboroughs cooled, and in 1710 she took 
2 CONT advantage of popular dissatisfaction with the Whigs to remove Godolphin; 
2 CONT Marlborough was dismissed the following year. During Queen Anne's reign 
2 CONT the kingdoms of England and Scotland were united (1707). She died in 
2 CONT London on August 1, 1714, and, having no surviving children, was succeeded

2 CONT 
2 CONT George was born at Herrenhausen Palace in Hanover (now in Lower Saxony 
2 CONT state, Germany) on November 10, 1683, and he grew up a German prince. In 
2 CONT 1705 he married Caroline of Ansbach, an intelligent woman who wielded 
2 CONT great influence over her husband and thereby on government. Like his 
2 CONT father, George II was more interested in Hanover than in Great Britain, 
2 CONT and during his many absences from London Caroline frequently acted as 
2 CONT regent. During the war of the Austrian Succession (1740-48), the king 
2 CONT subordinated the interests of Great Britain to those of his German 
2 CONT principality. This policy was unpopular in Great Britain, but the king won 
2 CONT admiration for his courage at the Battle of Dettingen in Bavaria (1743), 
2 CONT the last engagement in which a British monarch participated in person. 
2 CONT George II contributed to the material progress of Great Britain, mainly 
2 CONT because he was shrewd enough to listen to his wife and heed the advice of 
2 CONT his ministers. He retained Sir Robert Walpole as chief minister only upon 
2 CONT Caroline's insistence, and he later relied on Henry Pelham (1696-1754), 
2 CONT and, toward the end of his reign, William Pitt the Elder, although he 
2 CONT originally had a great dislike for him. George's reign was marked by the

2 CONT and, by decision of the Congress of Vienna, king of Hannover (1815-20). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The first of the Hannoverian house to be born and educated as an 
2 CONT Englishman, he was primarily interested in his royal prerogatives as king 
2 CONT of Great Britain in contradistinction to his two predecessors, to whom 
2 CONT Hannover was the main concern. George's aim was to rule as well as reign, 
2 CONT and he was a skillful and astute intriguer; by 1763 he had managed to 
2 CONT regain many of the powers that strong Whig ministries had appropriated 
2 CONT during the reigns of the first two Georges. His problem was that he lacked 
2 CONT the self-confidence and the mature statesmanship to form and achieve any 
2 CONT long-term policy. After the dismissal of several ministers who did not 
2 CONT satisfy him, the king found a firm supporter in Frederick North, 2d earl 
2 CONT of Guilford, prime minister from 1770 to 1782. Lord North executed the 
2 CONT royal policies that provoked the American Revolution. The unsuccessful 
2 CONT conclusion of that protracted conflict forced North to resign, and during 
2 CONT the government crisis that followed when three cabinets came and went in 
2 CONT less than two years the king himself was almost induced to abdicate. He 
2 CONT then took a political gamble by placing the government in the hands of the 
2 CONT 24-year-old William Pitt, thereby restoring stability for the rest of the 
2 CONT century. In line with his belief in royal authority, George favored the 
2 CONT wars with France (1793-1815) that grew out of the French Revolution. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1809 the king became blind. As early as 1765 he had suffered an 
2 CONT apparent dementia, and in 1788 his derangement recurred to such a degree 
2 CONT that a regency bill was passed, but the king recovered the following year. 
2 CONT It is now thought likely that he had inherited porphyria, a defect of the 
2 CONT metabolism that may in time lead to delirium. In 1811 he succumbed 
2 CONT hopelessly, and his son, later George IV, acted as regent for the rest of 
2 CONT his reign. George III died at Windsor Palace on January 29, 1820.

2 CONT 
2 CONT George was born in London on August 12, 1762, the eldest son of King

2 CONT (1756-1837), in 1785; less than two years later, to obtain money for his 
2 CONT debts, he allowed Parliament to declare the marriage illegal, which in 
2 CONT fact it was by the terms of acts governing royal marriages and succession. 
2 CONT In 1795, again to liquidate his debts, he agreed to a marriage with his 
2 CONT cousin, Caroline of Brunswick, but he became estranged from her in 1796 
2 CONT after the birth of their daughter, Princess Charlotte (1796-1817). His 
2 CONT misconduct alienated the British people, and when he tried to divorce 
2 CONT Caroline, charging her with adultery, she was so enthusiastically 
2 CONT supported by the London crowds that her trial had to be abandoned. His 
2 CONT cleverness and gracious manners, however, gave him the name of first 
2 CONT gentleman of Europe. George became prince regent in 1811, when his father 
2 CONT became mentally unable to discharge his duties, and succeeded to the

1 NOTE Victoria (queen), (1819-1901), queen of the United Kingdom of Great 
2 CONT Britain and Ireland (1837-1901) and empress of India (1876-1901). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Born Alexandrina Victoria on May 24, 1819, in Kensington Palace, London, 
2 CONT Victoria was the daughter of Victoria Mary Louisa (1786-1861), daughter of 
2 CONT the duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld; her father was Edward Augustus 
2 CONT (1767-1820), duke of Kent and Strathern, the fourth son of George III and 
2 CONT youngest brother of George IV and William IV, kings of Great Britain. 
2 CONT Because William IV had no legitimate children, his niece Victoria became 
2 CONT heir apparent to the British crown upon his accession in 1830. On June 20, 
2 CONT 1837, with the death of William IV, she became queen at the age of 18. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Early in her reign Victoria developed a serious concern with affairs of 
2 CONT state, guided by her first prime minister, William Lamb, 2d Viscount 
2 CONT Melbourne. Melbourne was leader of that wing of the Whig party that later 
2 CONT became known as the Liberal party. He exercised a strongly progressive 
2 CONT influence on the political thinking of the queen. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Marriage
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1840 Victoria was married to her first cousin, Albert, prince of 
2 CONT Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, whom she had known for about four years. Although this 
2 CONT was a marriage of state, it was a highly romantic and successful one, and 
2 CONT Victoria was devoted to her domestic responsibilities. The first of their 
2 CONT nine children was Victoria Adelaide Mary Louise (1840-1901), later empress 
2 CONT of Germany. Their first son, Albert Edward, prince of Wales and later king 
2 CONT of Great Britain as Edward VII, was born in 1841. When the conservative 
2 CONT Prince Albert convinced her that Liberal policy jeopardized the future of 
2 CONT the Crown, the queen began to lose her enthusiasm for the party. After 
2 CONT 1841, when the Melbourne government fell and Sir Robert Peel became prime 
2 CONT minister, Victoria was an ardent supporter of the Conservative party. Also 
2 CONT under Albert's influence, she began to question the tradition that 
2 CONT restricted the British sovereign to an advisory role. In 1850 she 
2 CONT challenged the authority of Henry John Temple, 3d Viscount Palmerston, 
2 CONT foreign secretary in the Whig government that had been in power since 
2 CONT 1846. Her position was that the sovereign should at least be consulted on 
2 CONT foreign policy. Palmerston, independent and self-assertive, ignored the 
2 CONT request. Their struggle reached a climax in 1851, when the prime minister, 
2 CONT Lord John Russell, who was also displeased with Palmerston's arbitrary 
2 CONT methods, dismissed him from the foreign office. Their altercations with 
2 CONT Palmerston, one of the most popular political leaders in the country, 
2 CONT caused Victoria and Albert to lose some of the esteem of their subjects. 
2 CONT Their popularity dwindled even more in 1854, when they tried to avert the 
2 CONT Crimean War. After the war had begun, however, they gave it their 
2 CONT wholehearted support. In 1856, shortly before the end of the war, the 
2 CONT queen instituted the Victoria Cross, the highest British award for wartime 
2 CONT valor. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1857, Victoria had the title of prince consort bestowed on Albert. Four 
2 CONT years later he died, and she remained in virtual mourning for much of the 
2 CONT rest of her life. She avoided public appearances, letting the prince of 
2 CONT Wales fulfill most of the royal ceremonial duties. Her detailed personal 
2 CONT interest in the affairs of state continued, however. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Reign After 1861
2 CONT 
2 CONT Several prime ministers served during the latter part of Victoria's reign, 
2 CONT but only the Conservative party leader Benjamin Disraeli, who held office 
2 CONT in 1868 and from 1874 to 1880, gained her confidence. He ingratiated 
2 CONT himself with the queen by a cultivated personal approach and flattering 
2 CONT gifts. He also allowed her a free hand in the awarding of church, 
2 CONT military, and some political appointments. She fully endorsed his policy 
2 CONT of strengthening and extending the British Empire, and in 1876 Disraeli 
2 CONT secured for her the title of empress of India. She rarely agreed with the 
2 CONT brilliant leader of the Liberal party, William E. Gladstone, who served as 
2 CONT prime minister four times between 1868 and 1894. Victoria disapproved of 
2 CONT the democratic reforms he enunciated, such as abolishing the purchase of 
2 CONT military commissions and legalizing trade unions, and his powerful 
2 CONT intellectualized method of argument. She was also strongly opposed to his 
2 CONT policy of home rule for Ireland. The Conservative leader Robert Arthur 
2 CONT Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3d Marquess of Salisbury, who served as prime 
2 CONT minister three times between 1885 and 1902, more often found favor with 
2 CONT the queen. Like Disraeli, he advocated protecting British interests and 
2 CONT increasing British influence abroad. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT British Idol
2 CONT 
2 CONT Victoria's popularity reached its height in the last two decades of her 
2 CONT reign, and it was shared by all classes in British society. Her golden 
2 CONT jubilee in 1887 and her diamond jubilee in 1897 were occasions for great 
2 CONT public rejoicing. Her subjects were then enjoying an unprecedented period 
2 CONT of prosperous complacency, and her enthusiastic execution of the Boer War 
2 CONT increased her appeal at home and abroad. Victoria died on January 22, 
2 CONT 1901. Her 63-year reign was the longest in the history of England. Her 
2 CONT descendants, including 40 grandchildren, married into almost every royal 
2 CONT family of Europe. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT With her personal example of honesty, patriotism, and devotion to family 
2 CONT life, Victoria became a living symbol of the solidity of the British 
2 CONT Empire. The many years of her reign, often referred to as the Victorian 
2 CONT age, witnessed the rise of the middle class and were marked by a deeply 
2 CONT conservative morality and intense nationalism. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Victoria's correspondence was published in three series, Letters, 1837-61 
2 CONT (3 vol., 1907), Letters, 1862-85 (3 vol., 1926), and Letters, 1886-1901 (3 
2 CONT vol., 1930-32).

1 NOTE The Edwardian period is named after him. He was christened Albert Edward. 
2 CONT He studied at the universities of Edinburgh, Oxford, and Cambridge. In 
2 CONT 1860 he visited Canada, inaugurating the custom of goodwill visits by 
2 CONT members of the British royal family, particularly the prince of Wales, to 
2 CONT British dominions and foreign countries. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The prince and his wife then assumed much of the burden of court 
2 CONT ceremonials and public functions, which Queen Victoria had laid aside on 
2 CONT going into virtual retirement after the death of the prince consort in 
2 CONT 1861. Edward traveled extensively. In Russia and France, particularly, he 
2 CONT made valuable personal contacts in political and social circles. At home, 
2 CONT his popularity was increased both as prince of Wales and as king by his 
2 CONT interest in sports, notably yachting and horse racing; his horses won the 
2 CONT Derby in 1896, 1900, and 1909 and the Grand National at Liverpool in 1900. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Edward succeeded to the throne in 1901. From the beginning of his reign he 
2 CONT adopted a policy of promoting international amity in Europe, where 
2 CONT political tension had been mounting. His visits to various European 
2 CONT capitals from 1901 to 1904 and return visits to him by European rulers 
2 CONT helped promote the signing of arbitration treaties in 1903-4 between Great 
2 CONT Britain and France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Portugal. He was also an 
2 CONT important force behind two agreements that strengthened the position of 
2 CONT Great Britain on the Continent, the Entente Cordiale of 1904 between 
2 CONT France and Great Britain, and a pact between Russia and Great Britain in 
2 CONT 1907. In 1909 the king and queen paid a diplomatic visit to Emperor 
2 CONT William II of Germany (Edward's nephew) that temporarily dispelled German 
2 CONT suspicion that the increasingly friendly relations between Great Britain 
2 CONT and France and Russia were aimed at weakening Germany. Because of his 
2 CONT efforts to increase international amity the king became known as Edward 
2 CONT the Peacemaker.

2 CONT 
2 CONT Edward was born June 23, 1894, in White Lodge, Richmond Park, and was 
2 CONT educated at the naval preparatory college at Osborne; the Royal Naval 
2 CONT College, Dartmouth; and Magdalen College, University of Oxford. During

2 CONT     
2 CONT Reign
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the death of his father, King George V, in January 1936, Edward was 
2 CONT proclaimed King Edward VIII. Before long, rumors circulated about his 
2 CONT alleged romance with an American, Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson 
2 CONT (1896-1986), then married to her second husband, a London shipping broker. 
2 CONT On October 20, 1936, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin counseled Edward, as 
2 CONT king and head of the Church of England, to remove all cause for the 
2 CONT rumors. A week later Mrs. Simpson was granted a divorce, to become final 
2 CONT in six months. In November the king confided to Baldwin that he intended 
2 CONT to marry Mrs. Simpson even if it meant his abdication. A morganatic 
2 CONT marriage was proposed, but the cabinet was unwilling to accept this 
2 CONT compromise. On December 11, 1936, therefore, the king abdicated in favor 
2 CONT of his brother, the duke of York, who became King George VI. Edward 
2 CONT received the title duke of Windsor and married Mrs. Simpson in June 1937. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Duke of Windsor
2 CONT     
2 CONT Because his wife was not accorded the privileges of a royal duchess in 
2 CONT England, the duke of Windsor resided abroad. In 1937 he observed social 
2 CONT and housing conditions in Germany and visited Adolf Hitler. During World 
2 CONT War II he served as a major general in the British Expeditionary Force, 
2 CONT and he was governor of the Bahama Islands from 1940 to 1945. After the war 
2 CONT he lived as a private British citizen, chiefly in the United States and 
2 CONT France. At the funeral of George VI in February 1952, he took part in a 
2 CONT British royal ceremony for the first time since his abdication. The duke 
2 CONT wrote A King's Story (1951) which was made into a film in 1967, and 
2 CONT Windsor Revisited (1960). He died May 28, 1972, in Paris.

1 NOTE Elizabeth II, full name Elizabeth Alexandra Mary (1926- ), queen of Great 
2 CONT Britain and Northern Ireland (1952- ), daughter of King George VI, born in 
2 CONT London. In 1944 she served as a councillor of state while her father was 
2 CONT on the war front in Italy. She married Prince Philip, duke of Edinburgh, 
2 CONT in 1947, and a year later gave birth to a son, Charles. In 1950 she gave 
2 CONT birth to a daughter, Anne. Elizabeth succeeded to the throne on the death 
2 CONT of her father in February 1952. A second son, Andrew, was born to 
2 CONT Elizabeth in 1960 and a third, Edward, in 1964. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Elizabeth's reign has been marked by vast changes in the lives of her 
2 CONT people and in the power and prestige of her nation. By the early 1980s, 
2 CONT some 40 former British colonies, protectorates, and mandate territories 
2 CONT had been granted their independence. Beginning in the mid-1950s, there was 
2 CONT constant turmoil in Northern Ireland. On the home front, the nation 
2 CONT suffered economic difficulties after World War II. Many industries were 
2 CONT nationalized, and in 1973 Great Britain became a member of the European 
2 CONT Economic Community. The primary role of Elizabeth throughout this period 
2 CONT was that of a symbol of unity and continuity within the Commonwealth of 
2 CONT Nations, the member nations of which she frequently visited along with her 
2 CONT husband.

1 NOTE She was a major force in French politics during the 30 years of Roman 
2 CONT Catholic-Huguenot wars and an instigator of the St. Bartholomew's Day 
2 CONT Massacre. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT She had little power during the reign of her husband and that of her first 
2 CONT son, Francis II, but on Francis's death in 1560 the government fell 
2 CONT entirely into her hands. She ruled as regent for her second son, Charles 
2 CONT IX, until he reached his majority in 1563, and she continued to dominate 
2 CONT him for the duration of his reign. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Political Role
2 CONT 
2 CONT In her determination to preserve royal power at any cost, Catherine 
2 CONT devoted her energies to maintaining a balance between the Protestant group 
2 CONT known as the Huguenots, led by the French military leader Gaspard de 
2 CONT Coligny, and the Roman Catholics, led by the powerful house of Guise. 
2 CONT During the religious civil wars that began in 1562, Catherine, a Roman 
2 CONT Catholic, usually supported the Catholics; sometimes, however, political 
2 CONT expediency led her to switch her support to the Huguenots. Her political 
2 CONT manipulations also affected the personal affairs of her family. In 1560 
2 CONT she arranged for her daughter, Elizabeth of Valois, to become the third 
2 CONT wife of the powerful Roman Catholic king of Spain, Philip II. In 1572 
2 CONT Catherine found it propitious to marry another daughter, Margaret of 
2 CONT Valois, to the Protestant king Henry of Navarre, who later became Henry 
2 CONT IV, king of France. Later in 1572 she found the growing Huguenot influence 
2 CONT over her son Charles, the French king, frightening; accordingly, she 
2 CONT instigated the plot to assassinate the Protestant leader Coligny that led 
2 CONT to his death and the deaths of an estimated 50,000 other Huguenots in the 
2 CONT St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (1572). After the death of Charles in 1574 
2 CONT and the accession to the throne of her third son as Henry III, Catherine's 
2 CONT power declined.
2 CONT     
2 CONT Art Patron
2 CONT 
2 CONT Apart from her political role, Catherine was a patron of the arts. Her 
2 CONT interest in architecture was demonstrated in the building of a new wing of 
2 CONT the Louvre Museum, in initiating construction of the Tuileries gardens, 
2 CONT and in building the château of Monceau. Her personal library, containing 
2 CONT numerous rare manuscripts, was renowned in Renaissance France.

1 NOTE He was remembered for his rivalry with the Habsburg Holy Roman emperor 
2 CONT Charles V, for his patronage of arts and letters, and for his governmental 
2 CONT reforms. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Francis represented the Angoulême branch of the Valois dynasty, succeeding 
2 CONT Louis XII, the last of the Orleanist branch, in 1515. His mother, Louise 
2 CONT of Savoy, and his elder sister, Margaret of Navarre, influenced his 
2 CONT upbringing and remained close to him during his reign. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Valois-Habsburg Wars
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1515 Francis personally won a spectacular victory over the Swiss at 
2 CONT Marignano, which enabled him to seize the Italian duchy of Milan. In 1519 
2 CONT he was a candidate for the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, but the 
2 CONT imperial electors chose Charles of Habsburg instead. He then embarked on a 
2 CONT war against Charles in Italy, but was defeated and captured at Pavia in 
2 CONT 1525. Imprisoned in Spain, he was ransomed and returned to France in 1527. 
2 CONT After another round of fighting, the two monarchs made peace in 1529, and 
2 CONT Francis married the emperor's sister, Eleanor. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Further inconclusive wars were fought against the Habsburgs in 1536-38 and 
2 CONT 1542-44. In this period the Catholic Francis did not hesitate to ally 
2 CONT himself with German Protestant princes and even with the Muslim Turks. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Religious and Financial Policies
2 CONT 
2 CONT Under his sister's influence Francis was sympathetic to Protestantism, 
2 CONT especially in its humanist form, when it appeared in France in the 1520s. 
2 CONT In the 1530s, however, he abandoned his earlier tolerance and became a 
2 CONT persecutor of the French Protestants. The king had concluded a concordat 
2 CONT with the papacy at Bologna in 1516, thereby gaining greater control of the 
2 CONT French Catholic church. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The cost of war obliged Francis to undertake extensive reforms. He floated 
2 CONT government bonds, punished royal fiscal agents who misappropriated funds, 
2 CONT and twice reorganized the treasury. He began openly to sell judicial and 
2 CONT financial offices, creating a new class of ennobled magistrates, which 
2 CONT remained an important element in French governmental and social structures 
2 CONT until the French Revolution. The traditional nobility served in his armies 
2 CONT and flocked to court to secure the patronage of the king or his favorites 
2 CONT among the magnates. In this way factions arose, and when the king died his 
2 CONT reign had lost much of its glamour. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Patronage of Art and Learning
2 CONT 
2 CONT Francis adopted the pose of a chivalric king, the first gentleman of his 
2 CONT kingdom, although his autocratic statecraft was informed by a shrewd 
2 CONT realism. His patronage of the arts was intended to augment the splendor of 
2 CONT his court. He brought Leonardo da Vinci and other great Italian artists to 
2 CONT France to design and ornament his châteaux. He employed the scholar 
2 CONT Guillaume Budé in creating a royal library and in founding professorships 
2 CONT of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, which formed the Nucleus of the later Collège 
2 CONT de France.

2 CONT his considerable gifts, failed to resolve the religious civil wars in his 
2 CONT country and brought it close to bankruptcy. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The third son of Henry II and Catherine de Médicis, Henry, born at 
2 CONT Fontainebleau on September 19, 1551, was his mother's favorite son. Henry 
2 CONT took part in the victories over the Huguenots at Jarnac and at Moncontour 
2 CONT in 1569. In 1572 he aided his mother in planning the Massacre of Saint 
2 CONT Bartholomew's Day. He was elected king of Poland in 1573, but after one 
2 CONT year returned to France to ascend the throne on the death of his brother, 
2 CONT Charles IX. The wars between the Roman Catholics and Protestants continued 
2 CONT throughout Henry's reign, and he took advantage of the strife to increase 
2 CONT his power. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1576 Henry issued the Edict of Beaulieu, which accorded more privileges 
2 CONT to the Huguenots. Displeased with the edict, the Roman Catholics, under 
2 CONT the leadership of Henri I de Lorraine, duc de Guise, then formed the Holy 
2 CONT League and renewed the war with the Huguenots. The war ended in 1577 with 
2 CONT the Peace of Bergerac. The league was revived in 1584, however, when 
2 CONT Henry's younger brother died, leaving Henry of Navarre (a Huguenot, the 
2 CONT future Henry IV of France) heir to the throne of the childless king. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In the following year, when the king excluded Henry of Navarre from the 
2 CONT succession and repealed all the privileges granted to the Huguenots, Henry 
2 CONT of Navarre began the so-called War of the Three Henrys against the league 
2 CONT and the king. After the termination of the war in 1587 Henry III found his 
2 CONT power rivaled by that of Henri de Lorraine. In 1588, on the Day of 
2 CONT Barricades, the citizenry of Paris, under the leadership of Henri de

2 CONT king subsequently had Henri de Lorraine and his brother Louis de Lorraine 
2 CONT (1555-88), assassinated and allied himself with Henry of Navarre, whom he 
2 CONT declared his successor. The two Henrys then became joint leaders of a 
2 CONT Huguenot army. While attempting to regain Paris on August 1, 1589, Henry 
2 CONT III was stabbed by Jacques Clément (1567?-89), a fanatical Dominican

1 NOTE Medici, Lorenzo de', called The Magnificent (1449-92), Italian banker and 
2 CONT statesman, who was a leading patron of art and scholarship during the 
2 CONT Renaissance. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Lorenzo was born in Florence on January 1, 1449, the son of Piero de' 
2 CONT Medici (1416-69), and on his father's death he assumed the direction of 
2 CONT the Medici bank, as well as de facto rule of the Florentine republic. He 
2 CONT was more successful as a politician and art connoisseur than as a bank 
2 CONT administrator, and his family's finances suffered from the expense of his 
2 CONT government. Lorenzo married into the noble Orsini family but ruled 
2 CONT initially without altering the old republican institutions, and he 
2 CONT remained officially a private citizen. His popular, efficient government 
2 CONT of the city and its dependencies was marred only by his approval of a 
2 CONT brutal sack (1472) of the rebellious town of Volterra. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1478 members of the Pazzi family tried to assassinate Lorenzo, and in 
2 CONT the aftermath of that affair the Medici punished some supporters of Pope 
2 CONT Sixtus IV implicated in the plot. The pope, backed by Naples, then 
2 CONT declared war on Florence. Pursuing the family policy of promoting peace 
2 CONT among the Italian states, Lorenzo ended the war by personal diplomacy. 
2 CONT This further increased his popularity with the Florentines and enabled him 
2 CONT to secure constitutional changes that enhanced his power. His last years 
2 CONT were devoted to establishing the careers of his children and guarding the 
2 CONT peace. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Himself a gifted poet, Lorenzo gathered at his court the leading artists

1 NOTE He was the first Bourbon king of France, who restored stability after the 
2 CONT religious wars of the 16th century. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT His father was descended in the ninth generation from the 13th-century 
2 CONT king of France, Louis IX. His mother was queen of Navarre and niece of 
2 CONT King Francis I of France. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Wars of Religion
2 CONT 
2 CONT Although baptized a Roman Catholic, Henry was brought up as a Calvinist by 
2 CONT his strong-minded mother, a leader of the French Protestant (Huguenot) 
2 CONT movement, which during the 1560s became involved in a series of civil wars 
2 CONT with the Catholics. Henry's wedding in 1572 to Margaret of Valois, sister 
2 CONT of the reigning monarch, Charles IX, was followed by the Massacre of Saint 
2 CONT Bartholomew's Day, in which thousands of Huguenots were slain on the 
2 CONT king's order (see Saint Bartholomew' Day, Massacre of). Henry saved his 
2 CONT own life by converting to Roman Catholicism, but he remained a prisoner at 
2 CONT court until 1576. After his escape he repudiated his conversion and 
2 CONT assumed the leadership of the Huguenot movement. Although he accepted his 
2 CONT unwilling wife at his court in Navarre, neither respected the marriage 
2 CONT vows. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Military Leader
2 CONT 
2 CONT Henry's storming of the fortress town of Cahors in 1580 launched his 
2 CONT career as an intrepid military leader. In many subsequent battles his 
2 CONT white plume was to be found wherever the fighting was fiercest. He won 
2 CONT another brilliant victory at Coutras in 1587, and two years later formed 
2 CONT an alliance with Charles IX's successor, Henry III, against the Catholic 
2 CONT League, which was dominated by the Guise family. When Henry III (the last 
2 CONT king of the Valois dynasty) was murdered by a league fanatic in 1589, the 
2 CONT Huguenot leader, who was next in line for the throne, proclaimed himself 
2 CONT king as Henry IV. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Backed by Spain and the pope, however, the league refused to acknowledge a 
2 CONT Protestant as king of France, and many Catholic nobles who had served 
2 CONT Henry III against the league deserted the royal army. Henry won victories 
2 CONT over the league at Arques and Ivry and besieged the league stronghold, 
2 CONT Paris, which was eventually relieved by a Spanish army from the 
2 CONT Netherlands. Henry skillfully exploited divisions among the leaguers, and 
2 CONT in 1593 he disarmed his opponents by announcing his reconversion to 
2 CONT Catholicism. A year later he bribed the league commander of the capital to 
2 CONT admit his army. One by one, he defeated or bought over the magnates of the 
2 CONT house of Guise who continued to resist. In 1595, when he officially 
2 CONT declared war on Spain, the pope granted him absolution. He could no longer 
2 CONT rely on the Huguenots, who drove a hard bargain to secure a new edict of 
2 CONT toleration. This was granted at Nantes in 1598, and it was followed by a 
2 CONT peace treaty with Spain. After that, serious resistance to his rule ended. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Henry as King
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1599 Henry secured papal annulment of his first marriage, and the year 
2 CONT after he married Marie de Médicis, a distant cousin of the mother of the 
2 CONT last Valois kings. His leading minister, Maximilien de Béthune, duc de 
2 CONT Sully, reorganized the finances and promoted the economic recovery of 
2 CONT France after decades of civil war. Agriculture, manufacturing, and 
2 CONT commerce were encouraged, the burden of taxation upon the peasantry 
2 CONT reduced, and the nobility relieved from the pressure of debt by declaring 
2 CONT a moratorium. The system by which officials in finance and the judiciary 
2 CONT purchased their offices from the Crown was formalized in 1604 by a tax on 
2 CONT office known as the paulette. At the same time Sully pursued a policy of 
2 CONT substituting royal officers for those employed by local representative 
2 CONT bodies. Until 1609 these measures were accompanied by an external policy 
2 CONT of peace. In that year Henry began preparations to intervene in Germany 
2 CONT against the Catholic Habsburg dynasty, a move that was opposed by some 
2 CONT French Catholics. The king was about to join his army when he was 
2 CONT assassinated by a Catholic extremist.
2 CONT   
2 CONT Henry IV's genial informality, bravery, gallantry, perseverance in 
2 CONT adversity, and readiness to bend religious principle to political 
2 CONT advantage have earned him a special place in French history. Not only did 
2 CONT he restore order and prosperity to his ruined kingdom but he also ensured 
2 CONT that the monarchy would be Catholic and absolutist.

1 NOTE He was known as the Sun King, who imposed absolute rule on France and 
2 CONT fought a series of wars trying to dominate Europe. His reign, the longest 
2 CONT in European history, was marked by a great flowering of French culture. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT His parents, grateful for an heir after 20 barren years of marriage, 
2 CONT christened him Louis Dieudonné (literally, the "gift of God"). 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Reign
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1643 Louis XIII died. Anne of Austria, aided by her minister, Cardinal 
2 CONT Mazarin, ruled France as regent. His father's death spared Louis XIV the 
2 CONT beatings and abuse usually given French princes; kindly but mediocre 
2 CONT tutors gave him a feeble education. His mother formed his rules of 
2 CONT conscience, teaching him a simple kind of Roman Catholicism laced with 
2 CONT superstition. Mazarin instructed him in court ceremony, war, and the craft 
2 CONT of kingship. The Frondetwo rebellions against the Crown between 1648 and 
2 CONT 1653impressed upon Louis the need to bring order, stability, and reform 
2 CONT to France and also fostered in him a deep suspicion of the nobility. In 
2 CONT accordance with the Franco-Spanish Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Louis 
2 CONT married his Spanish cousin, Marie-Thérèse (1638-83), in 1660. When Mazarin 
2 CONT died the following year, Louis shocked France by refusing to name a first 
2 CONT minister; he decided to rule alone and select Jean Baptiste Colbert as his 
2 CONT financial adviser. Colbert encouraged domestic industry and foreign 
2 CONT exports and rebuilt the French navy. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Despite his rakish youth, Louis XIV proved a hardworking king. Every 
2 CONT Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday he presided at a council meeting in which 
2 CONT he and a select group of ministers formulated policies that affected the 
2 CONT lives of his 20 million subjects. Louis developed two effective new 
2 CONT instruments of power: a corps of professional diplomats and a standing, 
2 CONT uniformed army. After 1682 the king spent most of his time at Versailles, 
2 CONT near Paris, where he had built a magnificent palace that became the 
2 CONT showplace of Europe. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Foreign Wars
2 CONT 
2 CONT In foreign affairs, Louis's consistent aim was to glorify France, to gird 
2 CONT its defenses on the northern and eastern frontiers, and to prevent any 
2 CONT resurgence of the power of the Habsburg dynasty, which had formerly 
2 CONT threatened France on two sides by its control over Spain and Germany. In 
2 CONT four wars he displayed before all of Europe his prowess as a military 
2 CONT leader. In 1667, claiming his wife's right of inheritance (jus 
2 CONT devolutionis), Louis invaded the Spanish Netherlands. His quick victories 
2 CONT prompted England, Holland, and Sweden to check France and force the Peace 
2 CONT of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). Louis gained 12 fortresses in Flanders and soon 
2 CONT isolated the Dutch by buying English and Swedish neutrality. In 1672 he 
2 CONT hurled an army against Holland. For six years the Dutch, aided by Spain 
2 CONT and Austria, staved off French attacks. The treaties signed at Nijmegen 
2 CONT (1678) did not dismantle Holland but gave Louis the Franche-Comté region 
2 CONT and more forts in Flanders. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT While his armies were battling Dutch Protestants, Louis had been denying 
2 CONT religious liberty to the Protestants (Huguenots) of France and tightening 
2 CONT control over his Roman Catholic clergy. In 1685, determined to force 
2 CONT conversion of the Huguenots, he revoked their charter of liberties, the 
2 CONT Edict of Nantes, forcing more than 200,000 into exile and igniting the 
2 CONT Camisards' revolt. Although applauded by his Roman Catholic subjects, the 
2 CONT revocation stiffened resistance to Louis in Protestant Europe. 
2 CONT Overconfident and ill-advised, he sent an army into the Rhineland in 1688 
2 CONT to claim the Palatinate for his sister-in-law Elizabeth Charlotte of 
2 CONT Bavaria (1652-1722). This War of the League of Augsburg (1688-97) revealed 
2 CONT serious deficiencies in Louis's army. Despite the devastation of the 
2 CONT Rhineland, the Peace of Ryswick (1697) did not improve French defenses or 
2 CONT add to the glory of the monarchy. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Louis's last military venture, the War of the Spanish Succession 
2 CONT (1701-13), stemmed from his acceptance of the Spanish throne on behalf of 
2 CONT his grandson, Philip. Louis's armies, opposed by an alliance of the 
2 CONT European powers, lost most of the major battles, but won control of Spain. 
2 CONT The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which awarded several French territories in 
2 CONT North America to the British, also recognized Philip as king of Spain. 
2 CONT Louis ruled a war-weary France until his health broke in 1715. Suffering 
2 CONT from fever and gangrene, he mustered enough strength to say, "I depart, 
2 CONT France remains," before dying.
2 CONT     
2 CONT Achievements
2 CONT     
2 CONT Parallel to Louis's quest for glory in war was his patronage of glory in 
2 CONT the arts. Molière and Jean Baptiste Racine wrote plays performed at his 
2 CONT court. Paintings by French masters ornamented his palaces, where the music 
2 CONT of Jean Baptiste Lully charmed his guests. Louis founded the academies of 
2 CONT Painting and Sculpture (1655), Science (1666), and Architecture (1671), 
2 CONT and in 1680 he established the Comedie Francaise. His grand palace at 
2 CONT Versailles afforded the ideal setting for his lavish court. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After Queen Marie-Thérèse's death in 1683, Louis secretly married a pious 
2 CONT and previously obscure woman, Françoise d'Aubigné, known as Madame de 
2 CONT Maintenon; she urged him to suppress spectacles and sin. Louis's interest 
2 CONT in improving Paris, however, never waned. He razed the city's medieval 
2 CONT walls, built the Invalides as a home for disabled veterans, planned the 
2 CONT great avenue of the Champs-Élysées, and refurbished the Cathedral of Notre 
2 CONT Dame. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Louis XIV was never able to resolve the tensions between a governing elite 
2 CONT committed to efficiency and a society organized by rank, birth, and 
2 CONT privilege, which explains many of the failures of his reign. His personal 
2 CONT example of long, dedicated rule, however, made France the bureaucratic 
2 CONT model for 18th-century, absolutist Europe.

1 NOTE He fought a losing battle to keep his Roman Catholic empire together in 
2 CONT the face of emergent Protestantism and outside pressure. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the death of his father in 1506, Charles inherited the Burgundian 
2 CONT realm; following the death of Ferdinand in 1516, he became ruler of the 
2 CONT vast Spanish kingdom; and when Maximilian died in 1519, he gained the 
2 CONT duchy of Austria and with his younger brother, Ferdinand, later Emperor 
2 CONT Ferdinand I, succeeded to the duchies of Hungary and Bohemia of the house 
2 CONT of Habsburg. In 1519, Charles, having bribed the electors, was designated 
2 CONT Holy Roman emperor; he was crowned King of Germany in Aix-la-Chapelle (now 
2 CONT Aachen, Germany), on October 23, 1520. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Charles was now by far the most powerful sovereign in Christendom. His 
2 CONT inherited lands far exceeded those of the Frankish emperor Charlemagne. 
2 CONT His territory included the Spanish kingdoms of Aragón and Castile; the 
2 CONT Netherlands; the Italian states of Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia; Spanish 
2 CONT conquests in America and Africa; and the Habsburg lands. He ascended the 
2 CONT imperial throne at a time when Germany was agitated by Martin Luther. In 
2 CONT an unsuccessful attempt to restore tranquillity, a great diet was held in 
2 CONT Worms in 1521, before which Luther made a memorable defense of his 
2 CONT doctrines. At this time rivalry between France and Spain over the Italian 
2 CONT lands and Burgundy led King Francis I of France to take up arms against 
2 CONT Charles, whose attention was drawn away from Germany's internal affairs. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The war between Charles and Francis, in which Charles was allied with 
2 CONT Henry VIII of England and the powerful Charles, duke of Bourbon 
2 CONT (1490-1527), proved disastrous to France. Francis was taken prisoner in 
2 CONT 1525, when the French were defeated at Pavia (near Milan, Italy). In 
2 CONT January 1526 he was forced to sign the Treaty of Madrid, relinquishing his 
2 CONT claim to Italy and abandoning Burgundy. Soon after his release the 
2 CONT following year, Francis renewed the struggle, now aided by Henry VIII and 
2 CONT Pope Clement VII, who was anxious to rid Italy of the imperial armies. The 
2 CONT pope was captured at Rome in 1527 and was kept captive for seven months. 
2 CONT The war ended with the signing by Charles and Francis of the Peace of 
2 CONT Cambrai in 1529. Francis again renounced the Italian lands, and Charles 
2 CONT ceded Burgundy to France. In 1530 the pope crowned the victorious monarch 
2 CONT in Bologna as Holy Roman emperor, the last coronation of a German emperor 
2 CONT by the pope. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Charles had been anxious to end the war with the French so that he could 
2 CONT put down the religious revolt in Germany and prevent the Ottoman Turks 
2 CONT from overrunning Europe. The Turks controlled the Balkan Peninsula, and in 
2 CONT 1526, the year that Ferdinand I laid claim to the Hungarian throne, Sultan 
2 CONT Suleiman swept over Hungary. Three years later the Turks laid siege to 
2 CONT Vienna. In 1535 the Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, in the service of 
2 CONT Charles, led an expedition to Africa, defeated the Turks at Tunis, and 
2 CONT freed about 20,000 Christian slaves. In 1538 Charles formed an 
2 CONT anti-Turkish alliance with Pope Paul III and the city-state of Venice. The 
2 CONT alliance was unsuccessful, and in 1547 Ferdinand signed a 5-year treaty 
2 CONT with the Turks. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The failure of Charles to repel the Turks resulted in part from his 
2 CONT inability to bring religious peace to his empire, particularly Germany. 
2 CONT The spread of disorder during the Reformation emboldened the German 
2 CONT princes to seek autonomy for their states. The peasants took advantage of 
2 CONT the turmoil in 1524 and revolted. In 1530, shortly after his coronation, 
2 CONT Charles convoked a diet in Augsburg to discuss the religious problem. The 
2 CONT Protestant princes stated their creed in the Augsburg Confession, which 
2 CONT was unacceptable to Charles. Negotiations thereafter failed, and in 1531 
2 CONT the princes formed the Schmalkaldic League. The domestic unrest and the 
2 CONT continued war with the Turks forced the emperor to postpone his 
2 CONT suppression of the Protestants and to grant them some liberties in 1532 in 
2 CONT the Peace of Nuremberg. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1536 Charles was again at war with France. The war was terminated by 
2 CONT the Treaty of Nice in 1538, granting Francis most of the Piedmont region 
2 CONT of Italy. The war was resumed in 1542 and ended in 1544 by the Treaty of 
2 CONT Crépy, which largely reaffirmed the earlier Peace of Cambrai. Charles, no 
2 CONT longer fighting the French or Turks, turned his attention to the princes 
2 CONT and the city-states of the Schmalkaldic League. In 1546 the emperor moved 
2 CONT against the southern German principalities, and at Mühlberg, Saxony, on 
2 CONT April 24, 1547, he scored a decisive victory against the Protestants. His 
2 CONT success was temporary; in 1551 Magdeburg, a great stronghold of 
2 CONT Protestantism, fell to Maurice, duke of Saxony (1521-53), but Maurice, who 
2 CONT had previously supported the emperor, suddenly deserted Charles, allying 
2 CONT himself with King Henry II of France. Charles fled before the Protestants. 
2 CONT In 1552, through his brother Ferdinand, he concluded the Peace of Passau, 
2 CONT by which the Lutheran states were allowed the exercise of their religion. 
2 CONT In 1555 the settlement was reaffirmed in the Peace of Augsburg. Meanwhile, 
2 CONT in 1552, Henry II had seized the bishoprics of Toul, Metz, and Verdun, and 
2 CONT an attempt by the emperor to reconquer Metz failed. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Weary of the constant struggles and heavy responsibilities of his 
2 CONT scattered realms, Charles in 1555 resigned the Netherlands and, in 1556, 
2 CONT Spain, to his son Philip II. In 1558 Charles abdicated the imperial crown 
2 CONT in favor of his brother, Ferdinand I, and retired to the monastery of San 
2 CONT Jerónimo de Yuste in Estremadura, Spain.

1 NOTE Ferdinand I (Holy Roman Empire) (1503-64), Holy Roman emperor (1558-64),

2 CONT Philip I, king of Castile, and Joanna the Mad (1479-1555), queen of 
2 CONT Castile, he was born on March 10, 1503, at Alcalá de Henares, Spain. In 
2 CONT 1521, he became governor of the duchy of Württemberg and of the Habsburg 
2 CONT hereditary lands, where he sought to check the spread of the Reformation. 
2 CONT When his brother-in-law, King Louis II of Hungary, died in 1526, Ferdinand 
2 CONT claimed through his wife the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. He was 
2 CONT crowned king by the Bohemians early in 1527. Although crowned almost 
2 CONT simultaneously in Hungary, he was rejected there by the nobles, who were 
2 CONT led by John I Zápolya and supported by the Turks. A long series of 
2 CONT indecisive wars ensued against the Ottoman Turks and the forces of John I 
2 CONT and his son, John II. A truce finally concluded in 1562 gave Ferdinand 
2 CONT sovereignty over a small part of Hungary, for which he was obliged to pay 
2 CONT tribute to the Turks. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Meanwhile, in 1531, Ferdinand had been elected king of Germany as a reward 
2 CONT for his loyalty to his brother, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Good 
2 CONT relations between the brothers, however, did not continue because Charles 
2 CONT reserved the imperial crown for his son Philip, later King Philip II of 
2 CONT Spain, instead of for Ferdinand. Friendly feeling was restored in 1555, 
2 CONT largely because Ferdinand successfully arranged the Treaty of Passau in 
2 CONT 1552 and the peace of Augsburg in 1555. On Charles's abdication in 1556 of 
2 CONT the Spanish crown, Philip was made king of Spain, while Ferdinand assumed 
2 CONT the duties of emperor; he was not crowned, however, until after Charles's 
2 CONT formal abdication as emperor in 1558. Subsequently Ferdinand attempted to 
2 CONT effect a reunion of Roman Catholics and Protestants but failed because he 
2 CONT insisted that bishops retain their secular authority. He died on July 25, 
2 CONT 1564, in Vienna.

2 CONT (1493-1519), who established the Habsburg dynasty as an international 
2 CONT European power. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Maximilian, the eldest son of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, was born 
2 CONT in Wiener Neustadt, Austria, on March 22, 1459. In 1477 he married Mary 
2 CONT (1457-82), daughter of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, but his right 
2 CONT to the Burgundian realm which included the present Benelux countries and 
2 CONT considerable portions of what is now northern and eastern Francewas 
2 CONT challenged by the French king, Louis XI. Maximilian successfully defended 
2 CONT his wife's inheritance in a war with France that lasted until 1493, and he 
2 CONT subdued the rebellious cities of the Netherlands. In 1490 he recovered 
2 CONT Austria, which had been occupied by Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, 
2 CONT and by the Treaty of Pressburg (1491) secured the right of succession to 
2 CONT the thrones of Hungary and Bohemia, which were held by the Habsburg family 
2 CONT for the next four centuries. Succeeding his father as king and emperor in 
2 CONT 1493, he embarked on a war to prevent France from acquiring territory in 
2 CONT Italy two years later. In 1496 he arranged the marriage of his son Philip 
2 CONT to Joanna (1479-1555), heiress to the thrones of Castile and Aragón, thus 
2 CONT laying the basis for two centuries of Habsburg rule in Spain. Maximilian 
2 CONT made peace with Louis XII of France in 1504, and four years later joined 
2 CONT Louis in the League of Cambrai against Venice. In 1511, however, he again 
2 CONT opposed France in an alliance (the Holy League) with England, Spain, and 
2 CONT the pope, and he was largely responsible for the imperial and English 
2 CONT victory over the French in the Battle of the Spurs (1513). Maximilian was 
2 CONT a patron of the arts; his writings include two autobiographical poems. He 
2 CONT died at Wels, Austria, on January 12, 1519.

1 NOTE He was also king of Prussia (1888-1918), whose policies helped bring about 
2 CONT World War I. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT William, also known as Kaiser Wilhelm, was educated at the University of 
2 CONT Bonn. In 1881, after a period of military service, he was married. He 
2 CONT became emperor in 1888 upon the death of his father, who had reigned for 
2 CONT only three months. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT William II's first major action as emperor was his dismissal in 1890 of 
2 CONT the aged chancellor Prince Otto von Bismarck, who had been largely 
2 CONT responsible for the growth of the German Empire under the emperor's 
2 CONT grandfather, William I. Thereafter he participated significantly, often 
2 CONT decisively, in the formulation of foreign and domestic policies. His 
2 CONT administration of internal affairs was marked by the rapid transformation 
2 CONT of Germany from an agricultural to a major industrial state and by the 
2 CONT accompanying development of serious problems in capital-labor relations. 
2 CONT William was only partially successful in his attempts to curb the growth 
2 CONT of Germany's Social Democratic party, which ultimately became the largest 
2 CONT political group in the empire. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The emperor believed that he ruled by divine right; foreign affairs 
2 CONT interested him, but his policies were contradictory and confused. He 
2 CONT professed deep friendship for Great Britain but drove that country into an 
2 CONT alliance with France and Russia by his aggressive program of colonial, 
2 CONT commercial, and naval expansion. Similarly, his policy of friendship with 
2 CONT Russia and support of Russian ambitions in the Far East was negated by his 
2 CONT encouragement of Austro-Hungarian actions in the Balkans. He believed 
2 CONT firmly in the efficacy of the Triple Alliance as a deterrent to war, and 
2 CONT he probably was devoid of militaristic ambitions. Imperial policy under 
2 CONT his impulsive guidance severely aggravated the international frictions 
2 CONT that culminated in World War I. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During the war William's position became increasingly that of a 
2 CONT figurehead. Realizing his own incapacity as a military leader, he left the 
2 CONT responsibility for military decisions increasingly to the German generals 
2 CONT Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. He ignored the 1917 peace 
2 CONT resolutions submitted by the Reichstag and urged continuation of the war. 
2 CONT Failure of the German offensive of 1918 brought mounting unrest to the 
2 CONT German armies and people, and on November 10, a day before the armistice 
2 CONT was signed, William left his country and went to Holland. During the peace 
2 CONT negotiations at Versailles, various representatives of the victorious 
2 CONT Allies urged vainly that William be extradited and tried as a war 
2 CONT criminal. He spent his remaining years in complete seclusion at Doorn 
2 CONT Castle in the Netherlands. He lived to see the resurgence of German armed 
2 CONT power and after his death was buried with military honors by order of 
2 CONT Hitler.

2 CONT Richard, duke of York, were confined in the Tower of London shortly after 
2 CONT their father's death in April 1483. They were not seen again outside the

1 NOTE He was the last king of the house of York.  He was named duke of 
2 CONT Gloucester in 1461. Richard fought for his brother, later King Edward IV, 
2 CONT under the Yorkist banner during the Wars of the Roses. On the death of 
2 CONT Edward in 1483, Richard took over the care of Edward's young heir, King 
2 CONT Edward V, and the administration of the kingdom. Richard soon overthrew 
2 CONT the unpopular party of the Woodvilles, relatives of the queen mother, who 
2 CONT aimed to control the government. Parliament then declared that Richard was 
2 CONT the rightful king, on the grounds that the marriage of Edward IV with 
2 CONT Elizabeth Woodville had been illegal because he had contracted earlier to 
2 CONT marry another woman. Richard, to ensure his position as king, confined 
2 CONT Edward and his brother Richard to the Tower of London. There, some time 
2 CONT afterward, both nephews were put to death. Except for later supposition, 
2 CONT no substantial evidence exists that Richard had them assassinated. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The new king courted popularity with considerable success. He promoted 
2 CONT English interests abroad and involved himself in domestic reform. 
2 CONT Following the death of the young princes, however, public favor turned 
2 CONT away from Richard and toward Henry, earl of Richmond, who was the head of 
2 CONT the rival house of Lancaster. On August 7, 1485, Henry landed at Milford 
2 CONT Haven, Wales, collecting allies as he advanced toward England. Richard 
2 CONT hastened to meet him, and the hostile armies faced each other on Bosworth 
2 CONT Field. Richard fought valiantly but was defeated and slain, and the earl 
2 CONT of Richmond became Henry VII, the first Tudor king of England. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although Richard, the last king of the house of York, did usurp the 
2 CONT throne, little doubt exists that his unscrupulousness has been 
2 CONT overemphasized by his enemies and by Tudor historians seeking to 
2 CONT strengthen the Lancastrian position. His baseness is strongly exaggerated

2 CONT Clarence, George Plantagenet, Duke of (1449-78), son of Richard, duke of 
2 CONT York, and brother of Edward IV, king of England, born in Dublin. The title 
2 CONT duke of Clarence was revived for him in 1461 by Edward, and the following 
2 CONT year he became lord lieutenant of Ireland. In 1469, in defiance of his 
2 CONT brother, he married a daughter of Richard Neville, earl of Warwick. During 
2 CONT the Wars of the Roses, Clarence first supported Warwick and the deposed 
2 CONT Lancastrian king, Henry VI, against his brother Edward IV, but he later 
2 CONT turned to aid Edward and the Yorkist faction. After the death of his 
2 CONT father-in-law in 1471, Clarence shared the Warwick estates with his 
2 CONT brother Richard, duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III), but retained 
2 CONT the title earl of Warwick. Suspected of seeking the crown, Clarence was 
2 CONT imprisoned, convicted by Parliament, and murdered in the Tower of London. 
2 CONT His only son, Edward, earl of Warwick (1475-99), was imprisoned in the 
2 CONT tower at the age of ten and was beheaded on the order of the Tudor king 
2 CONT Henry VII. Shakespeare recounted the story of Clarence in Henry VI, Part

1 NOTE Louis XV (1710-74), king of France (1715-74), whose failure to provide 
2 CONT strong leadership and badly needed reforms contributed to the crisis that 
2 CONT brought on the French Revolution. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Louis was born at Versailles on February 15, 1710, the great-grandson of 
2 CONT Louis XIV, whom he succeeded at the age of five. Philippe II, duc 
2 CONT d'Orléans, governed as regent until Louis reached his legal majority in 
2 CONT 1723. In 1725 the king married Maria Leszczyñska (1703-68), daughter of 
2 CONT Stanislas I of Poland. The following year he appointed his former tutor, 
2 CONT André Hercule de Fleury (1653-1743), as prime minister. Fleury gave France 
2 CONT a stable administration until his death 17 years later. Thereafter Louis 
2 CONT himself was in nominal control, but he took only a sporadic interest in 
2 CONT government and never followed any consistent policy at home or abroad. He 
2 CONT was frequently influenced by his mistresses, the most powerful of whom was 
2 CONT the marquise de Pompadour. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT France was involved in three wars during Louis's reign. As a result of the 
2 CONT first, the War of the Polish Succession (1733-35), France gained the 
2 CONT province of Lorraine. The second, the War of the Austrian Succession 
2 CONT (1740-48), which marked the beginning of a colonial struggle with Great 
2 CONT Britain, was indecisive. In the last, the Seven Years' War (1756-63), 
2 CONT France, crippled by corruption and mismanagement, lost most of its 
2 CONT overseas possessions to the British. French foreign policy in this period 
2 CONT was made chaotic by Louis's secret diplomacy, as his agents in other 
2 CONT countries sometimes pursued aims that were in conflict with those of his 
2 CONT own ministers. The situation improved somewhat in the 1760s, when a new 
2 CONT minister, the duc de Choiseul, restored some order to the government and 
2 CONT tried to repair the damage done by the Seven Years' War. In the last years 
2 CONT of his reign, Louis cooperated with his chancellor, René de Maupeou 
2 CONT (1714-92), in an effort to reform the country's inequitable and 
2 CONT inefficient system of taxation. In 1771 the parlements, or sovereign 
2 CONT courts, which had opposed reform, were reorganized and stripped of their 
2 CONT power to obstruct royal decrees. Measures were then implemented to tax the 
2 CONT previously exempt nobility and clergy, but these were reversed after the 
2 CONT king's death at Versailles on May 10, 1774. Louis XV's reported prophecy, 
2 CONT After me, the deluge, was fulfilled in the overthrow of the French 
2 CONT monarchy less than two decades later.

1 NOTE Philip V (of Spain) (1683-1746), king of Spain (1700-46), during whose 
2 CONT reign French ideas prevailed at his court, and French institutions were 
2 CONT introduced into Spain. The first of the Spanish Bourbons, he was the 
2 CONT grandson of Louis XIV, king of France, and the son of the dauphin Louis de 
2 CONT France (1661-1711), born in Versailles, France. Charles II, the last 
2 CONT Habsburg king of Spain, dying without issue, bequeathed Spain, the Spanish 
2 CONT Netherlands, and his Italian possessions to Philip, then duke of Anjou, in 
2 CONT 1700. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Philip's accession, by uniting the French and Spanish thrones in the same 
2 CONT family, threatened to disturb the balance of power in Europe. This 
2 CONT resulted in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14), in which France 
2 CONT and Spain were matched against an alliance formed by England, the 
2 CONT Netherlands, Austria, and several of the German states and subsequently 
2 CONT joined by Portugal and Savoy. The Peace of Utrecht secured the throne of 
2 CONT Spain to Philip but stripped Spain of Sicily, which passed to Savoy; the 
2 CONT Spanish Netherlands, which passed to Sardinia; and Milan and Naples, which 
2 CONT passed to Austria. Philip attempted to regain the lands in Italy that he 
2 CONT had lost, and war ensued from 1718 to 1720 against the Quadruple Alliance 
2 CONT of Great Britain, France, Austria, and the Netherlands. Through this war 
2 CONT and also through the War of the Polish Succession (1733-35) and War of the 
2 CONT Austrian Succession (1740-48), Philip gained territory for his sons. In 
2 CONT January 1724 he abdicated in favor of his eldest son, but after his son's 
2 CONT death the following August he resumed the crown. Philip was dominated by 
2 CONT his wife, Isabella Farnese (1692-1766), and in the last decades of his 
2 CONT life he was mentally incompetent.

1 NOTE Louis XVI (1754-93), king of France (1774-92), who lost his throne in the 
2 CONT French Revolution and was later beheaded by the revolutionary regime. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Louis was born at Versailles on August 23, 1754, the grandson of Louis XV. 
2 CONT The deaths of his two elder brothers and of his father, only son of Louis 
2 CONT XV, made the young prince the Dauphin of France in 1765. In 1770 he 
2 CONT married Marie Antoinette, youngest daughter of Archduchess Maria Theresa 
2 CONT of Austria. On Louis's accession, France was impoverished and burdened 
2 CONT with debts, and heavy taxation had resulted in widespread misery among the 
2 CONT French people. Immediately after he was crowned, aided by such capable 
2 CONT statesmen as Finance Minister Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, baron de 
2 CONT l'Aulne, Interior Minister Chrétien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes 
2 CONT (1721-94), and Foreign Minister Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes 
2 CONT (1717-87), Louis remitted some of the most oppressive taxes and instituted 
2 CONT financial and judicial reforms. Greater reforms were prevented, however, 
2 CONT by the opposition of the upper classes and the court. So strong was this 
2 CONT opposition that in 1776 Turgot was forced to resign and was replaced by 
2 CONT financier Jacques Necker. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After Louis granted financial aid (1778-81) to the American colonies 
2 CONT revolting against Great Britain in the New World, Necker proposed drastic 
2 CONT taxes on the nobility. He was forced to resign in 1781, and statesman 
2 CONT Charles Alexandre de Calonne (1734-1802), appointed finance minister in 
2 CONT 1783, borrowed money for the court until 1786, when the borrowing limit 
2 CONT was reached. The anger of the French people against taxes and the lavish 
2 CONT spending of the court resulted in 1788 in the recall of Necker, who, 
2 CONT however, could not prevent the bankruptcy of the government. In 1788 Louis 
2 CONT was forced to call for a meeting of the representative governmental body 
2 CONT called the Estates-General, the first gathering of that assembly in 175 
2 CONT years. Once in session, the Estates-General assumed the powers of 
2 CONT government. On July 14, 1789, the Parisian populace razed the Bastille, 
2 CONT and a short time later imprisoned the king and royal family in the palace 
2 CONT of the Tuileries. In 1791 the royal family attempted to escape to Austria, 
2 CONT but they were caught and brought back to Paris. Louis swore obedience to 
2 CONT the new French constitution in 1791, but continued secretly to work 
2 CONT against the revolution and to plot intrigues with France's enemies. In 
2 CONT 1792, when the National Convention, the assembly of elected French 
2 CONT deputies, declared France a republic, the king was tried as a traitor and 
2 CONT condemned to death. Louis XVI was guillotined on January 21, 1793, in the 
2 CONT Place de la Révolution (now Place de la Concorde) in Paris. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Historians consider Louis XVI a victim of circumstances rather than a 
2 CONT despot similar to the former French kings Louis XIV and Louis XV. He was 
2 CONT weak and incapable as king and not overly intelligent. He preferred to 
2 CONT spend his time at hobbies, such as hunting and making locks, rather than 
2 CONT at his duties of state, and he permitted his wife to influence him unduly.

2 CONT before the French Revolution. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Born in Vienna on November 2, 1755, Marie Antoinette was one of the 
2 CONT daughters of Holy Roman Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa. Her 
2 CONT marriage (1770) to Louis, the heir to the French throne, was intended to 
2 CONT cement an alliance between France and her parents' dynasty, the Habsburgs 
2 CONT of Austria. She and her husband had a daughter and two sons after he 
2 CONT succeeded to the throne in 1774. Disliked by the French as a foreigner, 
2 CONT she made herself more unpopular by her devotion to the interests of 
2 CONT Austria, the bad reputations of some of her friends, and her extravagance, 
2 CONT which was mistakenly blamed for the financial problems of the French 
2 CONT government. Especially damaging was her supposed connection with the 
2 CONT so-called Diamond Necklace affair, a scandal involving the fraudulent 
2 CONT purchase of some jewels (1785). 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, Marie Antoinette sided with 
2 CONT the intransigents at court who opposed compromise with the moderate 
2 CONT revolutionaries, and began appealing for help to her brother, Holy Roman 
2 CONT Emperor Leopold II. Marie and Louis tried to escape from Paris with their 
2 CONT surviving son in 1791, but were captured and brought back prisoners. In 
2 CONT 1792 the monarchy was overthrown, and after the execution of the king and 
2 CONT separation from her son, she was sent before the revolutionary tribunal 
2 CONT the following year. Sentenced to death for treason, she was guillotined in

2 CONT Succession and Rule
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charles VI's efforts to guarantee Maria Theresa's succession as ruler of 
2 CONT the Habsburg dominions led to the War of the Austrian Succession (see 
2 CONT Austrian Succession, War of the). The war lost her Austrian Silesia, but 
2 CONT she was able to retain her other dominions, and in 1745 she acquired the

2 CONT chancellor, Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz, she also drastically reordered 
2 CONT Austria's foreign policy, abandoning the traditional alignment with Great

2 CONT Evaluation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Pious and faithful but unfriendly toward the Enlightenment, Maria Theresa 
2 CONT has often been dismissed as a traditional dynast. Her actions derived from 
2 CONT a conviction that she held a trust from God and from a maternalistic 
2 CONT conception of her responsibilities. She was, however, intensely pragmatic, 
2 CONT conscious of the obligations of power, and a shrewd judge of her 
2 CONT ministers.

2 CONT 
2 CONT The eldest son of Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa, Joseph was 
2 CONT born in Vienna on March 13, 1741. He became emperor and coruler of the 
2 CONT Austrian lands with his mother when Francis died in 1765. During this

2 CONT Habsburg power, acquiring Galicia from Poland (1772) and Bukovina from 
2 CONT Turkey (1775). His attempt to annex Lower Bavaria, however, was thwarted 
2 CONT by Frederick II (the Great) of Prussia. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT As sole ruler after Maria Theresa's death in 1780, Joseph embarked on a 
2 CONT thorough reform of church and state in accordance with the rational 
2 CONT principles of the 18th-century Enlightenment. He granted religious 
2 CONT toleration to Protestants, ended discriminatory laws against Jews, and 
2 CONT drastically reorganized the predominant Roman Catholic church, closing 
2 CONT many monasteries, subjecting the education of priests to state control, 
2 CONT and limiting the power of the pope to intervene in Austria. Joseph 
2 CONT eliminated most forms of censorship, freed the serfs, separated the 
2 CONT executive from the judiciary, and promulgated a new law code. To unify the 
2 CONT administration of the various Habsburg realms, he abolished numerous 
2 CONT organs of local government and tried to impose the German language on his 
2 CONT Hungarian and Slavic subjects. In foreign affairs Joseph maintained close 
2 CONT ties with Russia. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Joseph's reforms met with resistance in many quarters, and before his

2 CONT Ferdinand II (Holy Roman Empire) (1578-1637), Holy Roman emperor 
2 CONT (1619-37), king of Bohemia (1617-19), and king of Hungary (1621-25). He 
2 CONT was born in Graz, Austria, the grandson of Emperor Ferdinand I, and was 
2 CONT educated by Jesuits, from whom he acquired a deep antipathy toward 
2 CONT Protestantism. Fearing that leadership by a militant Roman Catholic would 
2 CONT endanger their religious and possibly their civil rights, the Bohemians 
2 CONT rejected King Ferdinand in 1619, replacing him with Frederick V, elector 
2 CONT of the Rhenish Palatinate (1596-1632). This action by the Bohemian nobles 
2 CONT initiated the Thirty Years' War. Allied with Bavaria and the Catholic 
2 CONT League, Ferdinand, who had become Holy Roman emperor in 1619, defeated the 
2 CONT Bohemians at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, deposing Frederick and 
2 CONT sending him into exile. Ferdinand was waging war simultaneously against a 
2 CONT force of Hungarian Protestants led by Gabriel Bethlen. Following his 
2 CONT victory Ferdinand negotiated with Bethlen and secured the title of king of 
2 CONT Hungary. The imperial forces, commanded by the count of Tilly and Albrecht 
2 CONT von Wallenstein, were successful in the war against the Protestant forces 
2 CONT in Germany in 1625. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT By 1627 Ferdinand had outlawed all religions but Roman Catholicism and had 
2 CONT banished the Protestant laity and clergy from Bohemia. In 1629 the Edict 
2 CONT of Restitution empowered the Roman Catholic church to recover all property 
2 CONT seized by Protestants since the Treaty of Passau had imposed a religious 
2 CONT settlement on Germany in 1552. The edict, however, alienated some of 
2 CONT Ferdinand's allies, and this, together with the assumption of Protestant 
2 CONT King Gustav II Adolph of Sweden and the assassination of Wallenstein, 
2 CONT weakened the imperial authority. Although his armies won the Battle of 
2 CONT Nördlingen in 1634, Ferdinand was unable to carry out his plan to repress 
2 CONT Protestantism throughout the empire. The termination of the Thirty Years' 
2 CONT War was left to his son Ferdinand III.

1 NOTE Ferdinand VII (1784-1833), king of Spain (1808 and 1814-33), whose reign 
2 CONT was one of the most disastrous in Spanish history. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Born in the Escorial, near Madrid, on October 14, 1784, Ferdinand was the 
2 CONT son of Charles IV. He opposed the powerful Spanish minister Manuel de 
2 CONT Godoy (1767-1851), who, after the death of Ferdinand's first wife in 1806, 
2 CONT tried to force the marriage of the prince to a daughter of the late Louis 
2 CONT XVI of France. When Ferdinand instead proposed to a niece of Napoleon, 
2 CONT Godoy persuaded Charles to arrest his son for plotting to overthrow him. 
2 CONT Exploiting the situation, Napoleon invaded Spain. When a mob stormed the 
2 CONT royal palace, demanding the death of Godoy, the king, wholly dependent on 
2 CONT his minister, abdicated in favor of Ferdinand. Napoleon, however, had 
2 CONT other plans. Intending the Spanish crown for his brother, Joseph 
2 CONT Bonaparte, he invited Ferdinand to France, where he imprisoned him and 
2 CONT forced him to return the throne to his father. Charles IV then 
2 CONT obsequiously presented the Spanish crown to the French emperor. Ferdinand 
2 CONT remained a prisoner until 1813, when Napoleon, after the Peninsular War, 
2 CONT realized that Spain was lost to him. He then released Ferdinand, who 
2 CONT reascended the throne in 1814. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Ferdinand's rule was harsh and oppressive. In 1820, after several revolts, 
2 CONT a full-scale revolution broke out, instigated by liberal elements and 
2 CONT aided by the army. The liberal constitution of 1812, which the king had 
2 CONT set aside, was restored, and Ferdinand was imprisoned. In 1823, however, 
2 CONT the Holy Alliance sent a powerful French army to Spain, which restored 
2 CONT Ferdinand to the throne. In 1829 Ferdinand married his fourth wife, Maria 
2 CONT Christina of Naples (1806-78). Under her influence he abolished (1830) the 
2 CONT pragmatic sanction of the Salic Law, which passed succession to the 
2 CONT Spanish throne through males of the royal family. This act deprived 
2 CONT Ferdinand's brother, Don Carlos (1788-1855), of the throne and later led 
2 CONT to years of civil war. On Ferdinand's death in Madrid on September 29, 
2 CONT 1833, his daughter, Isabella II, was proclaimed queen, with her mother, 
2 CONT Maria Christina, as regent. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During Ferdinand's reign, Spain lost its colonies in North and South 
2 CONT America (except for Cuba and Puerto Rico) and suffered great loss of 
2 CONT prestige as a European power.

2 CONT mother, Queen Isabella II, took him with her from Spain when she was 
2 CONT deposed in the Revolution of 1868. He was educated in Paris, Vienna, and 
2 CONT Sandhurst, England. Isabella formally abdicated in favor of her son in

2 CONT 1875, when the monarchist general Arsenio Martínez de Campos (1831-1900) 
2 CONT summoned him to the throne. In 1876 Alfonso suppressed the last of the

2 CONT Carlos (1788-1855) to the Spanish throne. In the same year he ordered the 
2 CONT Cortes, the representative assembly, to draft a new constitution that 
2 CONT introduced a two-party system on the English model into Spanish politics. 
2 CONT Throughout his reign Alfonso was greatly influenced by his prime minister,

1 NOTE He was called the Citizen King.  Louis Philippe belonged to the house of 
2 CONT Bourbon-Orléans, a branch of the French royal family stemming from 
2 CONT Philippe I, duc d'Orléans, the brother of King Louis XIV. From his birth 
2 CONT until 1785 Louis Philippe was known as the duc de Valois and subsequently 
2 CONT as the duc de Chartres until 1793, when his father was guillotined, and he 
2 CONT succeeded him as duc d'Orléans. Like his father, he was in sympathy with 
2 CONT the French Revolution, the upheaval in France that resulted in the 
2 CONT establishment of the First Republic, and in 1790 he joined the Jacobins, 
2 CONT members of a French radical political club. Two years later, at the age of 
2 CONT 18, he was given a command in the revolutionary army and, as a colonel, 
2 CONT fought at the battles of Valmy and Jemappes. After the defeat of the 
2 CONT French army by the Austrians at the Battle of Neerwinden, Holland, in 
2 CONT 1793, Louis Philippe was implicated with his superior officer, the French 
2 CONT general Charles François Dumouriez (1739-1823), in a plot against the 
2 CONT republic, and he fled to Switzerland. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After the execution of his father by the French Revolutionary Tribunal, 
2 CONT Louis Philippe became the central figure about whom his supporters, the 
2 CONT Orléanist party, rallied; he did not actively enter into the intrigues for 
2 CONT restoring the monarchy, however, and during the regime of the Directory 
2 CONT and that of Napoleon, Louis Philippe remained outside France, traveling in 
2 CONT Scandinavia, the United States (where he lived for four years in 
2 CONT Philadelphia), and England. He also visited Sicily at the invitation of 
2 CONT Ferdinand I, king of the Two Sicilies, and in 1809 he married the king's 
2 CONT daughter Maria Amelia.
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1814, after the abdication of Napoleon, he returned to France and was 
2 CONT welcomed by King Louis XVIII, who restored to him the Orléans estates. By 
2 CONT the late 1820s, however, under the autocratic rule of Louis XVIII's 
2 CONT brother and successor, Charles X, the last of the Bourbon monarchs, the 
2 CONT French middle and lower classes were growing restive. Louis Philippe was 
2 CONT by this time the favorite of those Republican leaders who feared to arouse 
2 CONT the opposition of all Europe by establishing a republic, and hoped that 
2 CONT Louis Philippe would govern according to popular will. In 1830, by the 
2 CONT July Revolution that overthrew Charles X and the Bourbon dynasty in 
2 CONT France, Louis Philippe was proclaimed king by the Chamber of Deputies. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT At first Louis Philippe was content to rule as a citizen king and to 
2 CONT conciliate the Republicans who had helped bring him to power; he also 
2 CONT dispensed with many royal privileges. Gradually, however, while remaining 
2 CONT a constitutional monarch, he became more authoritarian, seeking not only 
2 CONT to establish the Bourbon-Orléans dynasty in France but also to consolidate 
2 CONT his position among the sovereigns of Europe. He arranged for the marriage 
2 CONT of his daughter Louise to Léopold I, king of the Belgians. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The last years of his reign were marked by corruption in domestic affairs 
2 CONT and by lethargy in foreign affairs. Louis Philippe, having tried to win 
2 CONT the favor of both the democratic and authoritarian elements, was at last 
2 CONT deserted by both sides and was deposed by the Revolution of 1848, which 
2 CONT led to the formation in France of the Second Republic (1848-52) and the 
2 CONT rise of Louis Napoleon, later Napoleon III, emperor of France. After his 
2 CONT abdication Louis Philippe lived with his family in England.

2 CONT European leaders of the pre-World War I era, he was deposed by the Russian 
2 CONT Revolution of 1917. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The eldest son of Emperor Alexander III, Nicholas was born at Tsarskoye 
2 CONT Selo (now Pushkin) on May 18, 1868. Educated privately, he was married in 
2 CONT 1894 to Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt (1872-1918), a German princess who took 
2 CONT the name Alexandra when she converted to Russian Orthodoxy. In the same 
2 CONT year his father died, and he succeeded to the throne. Believing firmly in 
2 CONT his duty to preserve absolute power in the Russian monarchy, he opposed 
2 CONT any concessions to those favoring more democracy in government, but had 
2 CONT little talent for leadership himself. He tended to rely for advice on his 
2 CONT wife, to whom he was devoted, and was influenced by her mystical beliefs. 
2 CONT Nicholas's interest in Russian expansion in the Far East was one of the 
2 CONT contributory causes of the disastrous Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), which 
2 CONT in turn helped touch off the Russian Revolution of 1905. Forced by the 
2 CONT revolution to assent to constitutional monarchy, he nevertheless continued 
2 CONT to believe he was responsible only to God. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT An advocate of international cooperation, Nicholas sponsored the Hague 
2 CONT Conferences, which created the Permanent Court of Arbitration and 
2 CONT formulated rules for the humane conduct of war, but failed to check 
2 CONT Europe's growing arms race. Despite his personally friendly relations with 
2 CONT his cousin, William II of Germany, their two countries were on opposite 
2 CONT sides when World War I broke out in 1914. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Russia's defeats and the suffering caused by the war among the people were 
2 CONT blamed on Nicholas, especially after he assumed personal command of the 
2 CONT army in 1915. Forced to abdicate in March 1917, Nicholas was held captive 
2 CONT by the Bolsheviks until executed, along with his family, at Ekaterinburg

1 NOTE Medici, Cosimo de' (1389-1464), Italian banker and statesman. Known as 
2 CONT Cosimo the Elder, he succeeded his father, Giovanni (1360-1429), as 
2 CONT director of the family's successful commercial and banking interests and 
2 CONT as leader of the popular faction in Florentine politics. Exiled by the 
2 CONT ruling aristocratic party in 1433, he was recalled the following year and 
2 CONT then assumed virtual control of the government; he secured his position by 
2 CONT banishing some of his enemies and ruining others by excessive taxation. A 
2 CONT shrewd politician, Cosimo avoided holding public office himself, governing 
2 CONT instead through supporters and dependents. His financial acumen benefited 
2 CONT both Florence and his family, and he was probably the wealthiest man in 
2 CONT contemporary Italy. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Cosimo encouraged agriculture, the silk industry, and commerce and sought 
2 CONT to maintain peace in Italy by a balance of power among the major states 
2 CONT and by preventing foreign interference. He actively patronized artists, 
2 CONT architects, and scholars and amassed a fine humanist library. His public 
2 CONT building program set a standard imitated by his family and other rulers.

1 NOTE He was among the most extravagant of Renaissance popes. Originally named 
2 CONT Giovanni de' Medici. He was made a cardinal deacon at the age of 13 and 
2 CONT elected pope at 37. He was an able administrator and skillful in politics 
2 CONT and foreign affairs. He succeeded in driving the invading French out of 
2 CONT Italy but in 1515 was defeated by Francis I, king of France. In 1516 the 
2 CONT relations of the papacy with France were settled through a concordat, 
2 CONT whereby the independence of the Gallican church (sometimes referred to as 
2 CONT Gallicanism) was ended. The king, however, received the power to name 
2 CONT bishops and other high church officials, who were then assured of 
2 CONT appointment despite the pope's theoretical power of veto. By Leo's 
2 CONT efforts, the papacy became the dominant political force in Italy. The 
2 CONT Fifth Lateran Council was concluded (1517) in Leo's pontificate; among its 
2 CONT actions were ratification of the concordat with France and the 
2 CONT establishment of a system of book censorship. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Leo was brought up in the Medici tradition of scholarship and appreciation 
2 CONT of arts and letters, and his fame rests more on his role as a patron of 
2 CONT the arts than as an ecclesiastical figure. He spent huge sums on projects 
2 CONT carried out by such masters as Raphael and Bramante. His extravagances as 
2 CONT a patron of arts, as in the rebuilding of Saint Peter's Basilica, and the 
2 CONT pomp of his court were indirectly responsible for the Reformation 
2 CONT movement. The sale of indulgences by the German monk Johann Tetzel and the 
2 CONT indignant response of Martin Luther in 1517 set in motion the upheaval 
2 CONT that created Protestantism. Leo condemned the Lutheran heresies and 
2 CONT excommunicated Luther and his followers in 1520.

2 CONT many English barons and by Matilda and her supporters, and his reign was 
2 CONT troubled by anarchy and constant internal wars. For six months in 1141 he 
2 CONT was Matilda's prisoner, during which time she reigned as queen. Stephen 
2 CONT was restored to the throne, but for five years Matilda and many of the 
2 CONT nobles continued to oppose him. During the course of the frequent civil 
2 CONT wars, much of the land was ravaged, and England was plunged into almost 
2 CONT complete chaos. In 1148 Matilda left England and gave up her claim in

2 CONT against Stephen until 1153, when Stephen was forced to name Henry his

2 CONT (1797-1888), emperor of Germany (1871-88) and king of Prussia (1861-88), 
2 CONT who reigned during the unification of Germany under the Prussian crown. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT William was born on March 22, 1797, in Berlin, the second son of Frederick 
2 CONT William III of Prussia and his queen Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz 
2 CONT (1776-1810). He entered the Prussian army in 1807 and served in the 
2 CONT Napoleonic Wars. In 1829 he married Augusta of Saxe-Weimar (1811-90), by 
2 CONT whom he had two children. Upon the accession of his childless brother 
2 CONT Frederick William IV in 1840, William became heir presumptive to the 
2 CONT Prussian throne. In 1858, after the king was declared insane, William 
2 CONT became regent, and three years later he succeeded to the throne. A firm 
2 CONT believer in the divine right of kings, he declared at his coronation that 
2 CONT he "ruled by favor of God, and of no one else."
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1862 William appointed the Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck his 
2 CONT chief minister. Subsequently they embarked upon a program of unifying the 
2 CONT German states under Prussian leadership. Their policies involved Prussia 
2 CONT in war with Denmark in 1864 and with Austria in 1866. In 1867, after the 
2 CONT defeat of Austria, William became head of the newly established North 
2 CONT German Confederation. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he took 
2 CONT personal command at the decisive Battle of Sedan. He was proclaimed German 
2 CONT emperor in the palace at Versailles on January 18, 1871, while his troops 
2 CONT were laying siege to the city of Paris. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During his reign William firmly supported the militarism espoused by 
2 CONT Bismarck as well as the latter's antidemocratic and anti-Catholic 
2 CONT policies. Two attempts to assassinate the emperor were made in 1878; on 
2 CONT the second occasion he was seriously wounded. On his death in Berlin on 
2 CONT March 9, 1888, his son Frederick William succeeded him as Frederick III.

2 CONT III, he was born in Berlin on October 15, 1795. He gave indications of 
2 CONT becoming a liberal monarch by increasing freedom of religion and relieving 
2 CONT press censorship on his accession to the throne in 1840. In 1847 he 
2 CONT convened the United Diet, which, although limited, was a step toward a 
2 CONT popular representative assembly. When revolution broke out in Prussia in 
2 CONT March 1848, he at first acceded to the demands of his people, promising a 
2 CONT constitution and agreeing to become the leader of a united Germany. In 
2 CONT 1849 he refused the imperial crown offered to him by the Frankfurt 
2 CONT Parliament, opting instead for a union of German states under Prussian 
2 CONT leadership (the Erfurt Union), proposed by his foreign minister, Joseph 
2 CONT von Radowitz (1797-1853). Under Austrian pressure, he abandoned this 
2 CONT project by the Treaty of Olmütz (November 1850). In the constitution 
2 CONT granted the same year, most of the governing power was vested in the king, 
2 CONT suffrage was restricted, and membership in the parliament was considerably 
2 CONT limited. After suffering two paralytic strokes in 1857, Frederick William 
2 CONT became mentally unfit to rule. In 1858 a regency was established under his 
2 CONT brother William, who, as William I, succeeded to the throne when Frederick 
2 CONT William died on January 2, 1861.

1 NOTE Frederick William I (1688-1740), king of Prussia (1713-40), who during his 
2 CONT reign made his kingdom into a major European state. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Frederick William was born on August 15, 1688, in Berlin, the son of King 
2 CONT Frederick I. He succeeded his father in 1713 and for the next seven years 
2 CONT was involved in a dispute with Sweden over Pomerania, a part of which he 
2 CONT finally received by the Treaty of Stockholm in 1720. In return for 
2 CONT recognizing (1726) the Pragmatic Sanction, by which Maria Theresa, 
2 CONT archduchess of Austria, was given the Austrian Habsburg dominions, he 
2 CONT hoped to gain support for his claim to the Lower Rhine duchies of Jülich 
2 CONT and Berg, but his expectations were dashed. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Frederick William's greatest accomplishment was in the internal 
2 CONT development of Prussia. Contemptuous of the luxury of his father's reign, 
2 CONT he instituted a system of rigid and efficient economy at court and 
2 CONT transferred public financial administration from local governments to the 
2 CONT central royal authority. He was thus able to repay the debts incurred by 
2 CONT his father and greatly improve the financial condition of Prussia. He 
2 CONT built up industry by forbidding the importation of finished goods and the 
2 CONT exportation of raw materials, and directed the colonization of nonpopulous 
2 CONT areas, especially in East Prussia. He also instituted compulsory 
2 CONT elementary education in Prussia. The development of the army was his 
2 CONT fondest achievement; he was particularly proud of the Potsdam Guard, 
2 CONT composed of exceptionally tall men hired, and sometimes kidnapped, from 
2 CONT all parts of Europe. Under his supervision the number of soldiers in the 
2 CONT army was increased from about 38,000 to some 83,500 and Prussia became the 
2 CONT third ranking military power in Europe. Frederick William died at Potsdam 
2 CONT on May 31, 1740, and was succeeded by his son, Frederick II, the Great.

1 NOTE During his reign, he was considered among the most notable of enlightened 
2 CONT despots in 18th century Europe. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT As crown prince he was trained, under his father's supervision, to become 
2 CONT a soldier and a thrifty administrator. Frederick, however, encouraged by 
2 CONT his mother and his tutors, showed a preference for courtly life, music, 
2 CONT and French literature. Frederick William, failing to understand the tastes 
2 CONT of his son, developed an open dislike for him. At the age of 18, Frederick 
2 CONT decided to escape to England; his proposed plan was discovered, and he was 
2 CONT arrested, imprisoned, temporarily deprived of his status as crown prince, 
2 CONT and forced to witness the execution of one of his two confederates. After 
2 CONT he had subsequently applied himself diligently to fiscal and military 
2 CONT affairs, Frederick was reinstated to his position as crown prince. He then 
2 CONT went to live for seven years on his estate at Rheinsburg, where, in his 
2 CONT leisure time, he studied philosophy, history, and poetry and corresponded 
2 CONT with the French philosophers, notably Voltaire. In his Antimachiavell, 
2 CONT written during that period and published by Voltaire in 1740, Frederick 
2 CONT idealistically opposed the political doctrines of the Italian statesman 
2 CONT and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, favoring peaceful and enlightened 
2 CONT rule. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT King and Military Leader
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the death of his father in 1740 Frederick became king and embarked 
2 CONT almost immediately on a policy of Prussian aggrandizement. When Maria 
2 CONT Theresa became archduchess of Austria in that same year, Frederick 
2 CONT demanded the cession of duchies of Silesia in return for Prussian 
2 CONT recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction, which gave the Austrian Habsburg 
2 CONT dominions to Maria Theresa. Refused by Austria, Frederick invaded Silesia, 
2 CONT commencing the War of the Austrian Succession. He led his forces to 
2 CONT victory at Mollwitz in 1741 and at Chotusitz in 1742; in the latter year, 
2 CONT by the Treaty of Breslau, Maria Theresa was obliged to yield the Silesian 
2 CONT territory demanded by Prussia. Frederick acquired East Friesland (now a 
2 CONT region of Germany) in 1744, on the death of the last ruler without heirs 
2 CONT of that principality, and in 1745 he fought and won a second war with 
2 CONT Austria, terminated by the Peace of Dresden, which assured Prussia the 
2 CONT possession of Silesia. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT By this time Frederick was recognized as an able military leader, and the 
2 CONT position of Prussia in Europe had risen considerably. The military 
2 CONT greatness of Frederick was demonstrated during the Seven Years' War, 
2 CONT fought from 1756 to 1763. Frederick and his forces, aided only by 
2 CONT financial assistance from Great Britain, which was at war with France, 
2 CONT opposed the armies of Austria, Russia, Sweden, Saxony, and France. The 
2 CONT Peace of Hubertusburg in 1763 awarded Prussia no new territory, as it 
2 CONT merely confirmed the boundaries that had existed before the war; at the 
2 CONT end of the war, however, Prussia was established as a rival to Austria for 
2 CONT domination of the German states. Frederick made an alliance with Catherine 
2 CONT II of Russia, in 1764, and by the first partition of Poland in 1772 he 
2 CONT received Polish Prussia, exclusive of Gdañsk (Danzig) and Toruñ (Thorn), 
2 CONT thus uniting the regions of Brandenburg and Pomerania. By the Treaty of 
2 CONT Teschen in 1779, after the War of the Bavarian Succession, a short 
2 CONT conflict with Austria, Prussia was awarded the Franconian principalities 
2 CONT of Bavaria; Austria retained only a part of Lower Bavaria. A further step 
2 CONT was made toward destroying Austrian dominance in 1785, when Frederick 
2 CONT gathered the German princes into a union of princes, the Fürstenbund, to 
2 CONT preserve the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Administrator
2 CONT 
2 CONT Frederick was extremely sympathetic to the American Revolution and was an 
2 CONT admirer of George Washington. He was one of the first sovereigns to 
2 CONT conclude a commercial treaty with the United States. He did not, however, 
2 CONT limit his activities to the international scene; internal affairs 
2 CONT flourished during his reign. His rule was absolute; he was a ubiquitous 
2 CONT administrator, constantly checking the work of his officials, from whom he 
2 CONT exacted the utmost in conscientiousness. Under his rule new methods of 
2 CONT agriculture and manufacturing were introduced. Marshes were drained, 
2 CONT providing new lands for cultivation and colonization and the institution 
2 CONT of serfdom, while not abolished, was somewhat liberalized. Under 
2 CONT Frederick's personal supervision the efficiency and size of the army were 
2 CONT increased. He reviewed the troops frequently, concerned himself with the 
2 CONT discipline of his officers and men, and wrote works for his generals on 
2 CONT the science of warfare. In 1747 Frederick, who was particularly interested 
2 CONT in the equitable distribution of justice to all classes, issued a new 
2 CONT codification of Prussian law, the Codex Fridericianus. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Patron of Culture
2 CONT 
2 CONT Frederick continued to patronize the arts and sciences throughout his 
2 CONT life. The Academy of Sciences again became an important center of learning 
2 CONT during his reign, and elementary education progressed as under no previous 
2 CONT Prussian sovereign. In his favorite residence, the palace of Sans Souci, 
2 CONT Frederick held court, but always entertained with judicious economy. 
2 CONT Contemptuous of the German language and culture, Frederick spoke French at 
2 CONT court and patronized French writers, many of whom, including Voltaire, 
2 CONT paid him visits in Berlin. Frederick himself was a musician, spending many 
2 CONT hours with his flute. He was also a prolific writer; his complete works 
2 CONT were published in 30 volumes between 1846 and 1857.

2 CONT was forbidden to princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Prussia, however, which 
2 CONT was part of Frederick's domain, lay outside the empire, and in 1701 
2 CONT Emperor Leopold I recognized Frederick as king of Prussia in return for 
2 CONT his military support in the War of the Spanish Succession. Frederick 
2 CONT crowned himself at Königsberg, expending vast sums of money on his

2 CONT undertook some projects beneficial to the welfare of Prussia, such as the 
2 CONT establishment in 1694 of the University of Halle and the founding in 1707

1 NOTE Frederick William (1620-88), elector of Brandenburg (1640-88), called the 
2 CONT Great Elector, who laid the foundations for the strong Prussian state of 
2 CONT the 18th century. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The son of Elector George William (1595-1640), Frederick William was born 
2 CONT on February 12, 1620, in Berlin. He succeeded to the electorate during the 
2 CONT Thirty Years' War, when Swedish forces were occupying Brandenburg. 
2 CONT Concluding an armistice with Sweden, he was able to repair some of the 
2 CONT war's damage to the country. He remained neutral until the Peace of 
2 CONT Westphalia ended the war in 1648; by that treaty he received eastern 
2 CONT Pomerania, along the Baltic Sea, and some smaller territories. Over the 
2 CONT next 30 years, by alliances and wars and systematic strengthening of his 
2 CONT army, Frederick William acquired more lands and power for Brandenburg. In 
2 CONT 1656, during the war between Sweden and Poland, he switched his allegiance 
2 CONT from Poland to Sweden and back to Poland in return for the latter's 
2 CONT recognition of his suzerainty over East Prussia, until then a Polish 
2 CONT dependency. In 1675 he defeated invading Swedish forces at Fehrbellin and 
2 CONT conquered western Pomerania, long coveted for its important seaports, but 
2 CONT at the insistence of France, Sweden's ally, he relinquished the territory 
2 CONT at the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1679. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Frederick William centralized government administration and improved 
2 CONT almost every area of public affairs, especially industry and commerce. 
2 CONT After the Edict of Nantes in 1685 he admitted large numbers of Huguenots, 
2 CONT who, with the technological skills they had acquired in France, aided in 
2 CONT the development of Prussian industry. He also created the Prussian navy, 
2 CONT founded colonies in western Africa, and established the Royal Library in 
2 CONT Berlin. He died in Potsdam on May 9, 1688.

2 CONT arranged a marriage for her with his son, Guildford Dudley (d. 1554). The 
2 CONT duke's purpose was to change, through Lady Jane, the royal succession upon 
2 CONT the death of the ailing young king, Edward VI, so that he could continue 
2 CONT to control the country through her. Edward approved the marriage and 
2 CONT secured witnesses to a deed declaring Lady Jane his successor. Upon the 
2 CONT death of the king, on July 6, 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen, but 
2 CONT Edward's half sister, Mary Tudor, contested the succession. Lady Jane was 
2 CONT subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London. She and her husband were 
2 CONT accused of treason, and both were beheaded on February 12, 1554.

2 CONT John I of Castile and León. Castilian invasions failed, and John cemented 
2 CONT his friendship with England by a treaty and by marrying Philippa of 
2 CONT Lancaster (1359-1415), daughter of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. John 
2 CONT was a popular monarch; his reign featured administrative reforms, the 
2 CONT flourishing of Portuguese culture, an emphasis on chivalry, the conquering 
2 CONT of Ceuta in North Africa from the Moors, and the discovery of the islands 
2 CONT of Porto Santo and Madeira. He was succeeded by his son Edward

1 NOTE Christian II (1481-1559), king of Denmark and Norway (1513-23) and of 
2 CONT Sweden (1520-23), the son and successor of King John (Hans; 1455-1513). A 
2 CONT gifted but erratic ruler, who initiated many humane reforms and was a 
2 CONT patron of culture and education, Christian sought to strengthen the 
2 CONT monarchy by championing the lower and middle classes, but in so doing 
2 CONT alienated the nobles, who still held the power to elect the king. Pressing 
2 CONT his claim to the Swedish throne under the Union of Kalmar, Christian 
2 CONT besieged and captured Stockholm in 1520, but when he followed his 
2 CONT coronation there with mass executions of Swedish nobles, he earned for 
2 CONT himself the epithet The Cruel and made it easy for Gustav Vasa to rebel 
2 CONT and win the Crown in 1523. That same year the Danish nobles also rose 
2 CONT against him, electing his uncle king as Frederick I. Christian then fled 
2 CONT to the Netherlands, where he finally persuaded his brother-in-law, Holy 
2 CONT Roman Emperor Charles V, to help him raise a small army; with that force 
2 CONT he landed in Norway in 1531. The year after, having made no gains, he was 
2 CONT treacherously captured by his enemies and spent the rest of his life, 27 
2 CONT years, in detention.

2 CONT series of new towns; as a builder he left a lasting mark on Copenhagen. 
2 CONT His foreign ventures were less fortunate. Despite personal bravery, he was 
2 CONT an undistinguished military leader, and his war against Sweden in 1611-13 
2 CONT succeeded in halting Swedish expansion into northern Norway mainly because 
2 CONT the Swedes were otherwise engaged. His participation in the Thirty Years' 
2 CONT War was disastrous, although he managed to win a lenient peace at Lübeck 
2 CONT in 1629. Even worse was the second war with Sweden (1643-45) in which 
2 CONT Denmark lost forever considerable territories in the Scandinavian

2 CONT charges of improper self-enrichment against their leaders, many of whom 
2 CONT were forced to leave the country. In 1657 Frederick began a war against 
2 CONT Sweden to regain provinces lost by his father. He was defeated and in 1658 
2 CONT signed the Treaty of Roskilde, ceding a portion of Norway and some Danish 
2 CONT islands to Sweden. Shortly after the conclusion of peace the Swedes 
2 CONT reopened the war and besieged Copenhagen. With aid from the German region 
2 CONT of Brandenburg, the Danes expelled the Swedes from the Jylland (Jutland) 
2 CONT Peninsula. In 1660, however, deserted by his allies, Frederick was obliged

1 NOTE Francis II (Holy Roman Empire) (1768-1835), last Holy Roman emperor 
2 CONT (1792-1806) and, as Francis I, first emperor of Austria (1804-35). Born in 
2 CONT Florence, Italy, and educated in Vienna, he succeeded his father Leopold 
2 CONT II as Holy Roman emperor. From the start of his reign until 1815 Francis 
2 CONT was involved in the wars of the French Revolution and in the Napoleonic 
2 CONT Wars. After the extension of French control over western Germany and the 
2 CONT reorganization of the German states by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1803, Francis 
2 CONT consolidated his power in Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, and northern Italy 
2 CONT and proclaimed himself emperor of Austria in 1804. Two years later he 
2 CONT formally dissolved the old Holy Roman Empire. As emperor of Austria, 
2 CONT Francis gave Prince Klemens von Metternich almost complete control of 
2 CONT foreign affairs after 1809 and devoted himself to the internal 
2 CONT administration of the empire. The marriage of his daughter Marie Louise 
2 CONT (1791-1847) to Napoleon in 1810 earned for Francis three peaceful years in 
2 CONT which to re-create Austrian strength for participation in the campaign 
2 CONT that would bring about (1814-15) Napoleon's downfall. By the decisions of 
2 CONT the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Francis recovered most of the territory 
2 CONT Austria had lost to Napoleon. The last 20 years of his reign were marked 
2 CONT by paternalistic measures, reactionary tendencies, and repression of 
2 CONT liberalism.

1 NOTE He consolidated and institutionalized many reforms of the French 
2 CONT Revolution. One of the greatest military commanders of all time, he 
2 CONT conquered the larger part of Europe and did much to modernize the nations 
2 CONT he ruled. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT No Buonaparte had ever been a professional soldier. Carlo was a lawyer who 
2 CONT had fought for Corsican independence, but after the French occupied the 
2 CONT island in 1768, he served as a prosecutor and judge and entered the French 
2 CONT aristocracy as a count. Through his father's influence, Napoleon was 
2 CONT educated at the expense of King Louis XVI, at Brienne and the École 
2 CONT Militaire, in Paris. Napoleon graduated in 1785, at the age of 16, and 
2 CONT joined the artillery as a second lieutenant. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After the Revolution began, he became a lieutenant colonel (1791) in the 
2 CONT Corsican National Guard. In 1793, however, Corsica declared independence, 
2 CONT and Bonaparte, a French patriot and a Republican, fled to France with his 
2 CONT family. He was assigned, as a captain, to an army besieging Toulon, a 
2 CONT naval base that, aided by a British fleet, was in revolt against the 
2 CONT republic. Replacing a wounded artillery general, he seized ground where 
2 CONT his guns could drive the British fleet from the harbor, and Toulon fell. 
2 CONT As a result Bonaparte was promoted to brigadier general at the age of 24. 
2 CONT In 1795 he saved the revolutionary government by dispersing an insurgent 
2 CONT mob in Paris. In 1796 he married Joséphine de Beauharnais, the widow of an 
2 CONT aristocrat guillotined in the Revolution and the mother of two children. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Campaigns
2 CONT 
2 CONT Also in 1796, Bonaparte was made commander of the French army in Italy. He 
2 CONT defeated four Austrian generals in succession, each with superior numbers, 
2 CONT and forced Austria and its allies to make peace. The Treaty of Campo 
2 CONT Formio provided that France keep most of its conquests. In northern Italy 
2 CONT he founded the Cisalpine (Italian) Republic (later known as the kingdom of 
2 CONT Italy) and strengthened his position in France by sending millions of 
2 CONT francs worth of treasure to the government. In 1798, to strike at British 
2 CONT trade with the East, he led an expedition to Turkish-ruled Egypt, which he 
2 CONT conquered. His fleet, however, was destroyed by the British admiral 
2 CONT Horatio Nelson, leaving him stranded. Undaunted, he reformed the Egyptian 
2 CONT government and law, abolishing serfdom and feudalism and guaranteeing 
2 CONT basic rights. The French scholars he had brought with him began the 
2 CONT scientific study of ancient Egyptian history. In 1799 he failed to capture 
2 CONT Syria, but he won a smashing victory over the Turks at Abu Qir (Abukir). 
2 CONT France, meanwhile, faced a new coalition; Austria, Russia, and lesser 
2 CONT powers had allied with Britain. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Napoleonic Rule in France
2 CONT     
2 CONT Bonaparte, no modest soul, decided to leave his army and return to save 
2 CONT France. In Paris, he joined a conspiracy against the government. In the 
2 CONT coup d'etat of November 9-10, 1799 (18-19 Brumaire), he and his colleagues 
2 CONT seized power and established a new regimethe Consulate. Under its 
2 CONT constitution, Bonaparte, as first consul, had almost dictatorial powers. 
2 CONT The constitution was revised in 1802 to make Bonaparte consul for life and 
2 CONT in 1804 to create him emperor. Each change received the overwhelming 
2 CONT assent of the electorate. In 1800, he assured his power by crossing the 
2 CONT Alps and defeating the Austrians at Marengo. He then negotiated a general 
2 CONT European peace that established the Rhine River as the eastern border of 
2 CONT France. He also concluded an agreement with the pope (the Concordat of 
2 CONT 1801), which contributed to French domestic tranquillity by ending the 
2 CONT quarrel with the Roman Catholic church that had arisen during the 
2 CONT Revolution. In France the administration was reorganized, the court system 
2 CONT was simplified, and all schools were put under centralized control. French 
2 CONT law was standardized in the Code Napoleon, or civil code, and six other 
2 CONT codes. They guaranteed the rights and liberties won in the Revolution, 
2 CONT including equality before the law and freedom of religion. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Wars of Conquest
2 CONT 
2 CONT In April 1803 Britain, provoked by Napoleon's aggressive behavior, resumed 
2 CONT war with France on the seas; two years later Russia and Austria joined the 
2 CONT British in a new coalition. Napoleon then abandoned plans to invade 
2 CONT England and turned his armies against the Austro-Russian forces, defeating 
2 CONT them at the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805. In 1806 he seized 
2 CONT the kingdom of Naples and made his elder brother Joseph king, converted 
2 CONT the Dutch Republic into the kingdom of Holland for his brother Louis, and 
2 CONT established the Confederation of the Rhine (most of the German states) of 
2 CONT which he was protector. Prussia then allied itself with Russia and 
2 CONT attacked the confederation. Napoleon destroyed the Prussian army at Jena 
2 CONT and Auerstädt (1806) and the Russian army at Friedland. At Tilsit (July 
2 CONT 1807), Napoleon made an ally of Czar Alexander I and greatly reduced the 
2 CONT size of Prussia (see Tilsit, Treaty of). He also added new states to the 
2 CONT empire: the kingdom of Westphalia, under his brother Jerome, the duchy of 
2 CONT Warsaw, and others. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Napoleon had meanwhile established the Continental System, a 
2 CONT French-imposed blockade of Europe against British goods, designed to 
2 CONT bankrupt what he called the nation of shopkeepers. In 1807 Napoleon 
2 CONT seized Portugal. In 1808, he made his brother Joseph king of Spain, 
2 CONT awarding Naples to his brother-in-law, Joachim Murat. Joseph's arrival in 
2 CONT Spain touched off a rebellion there, which became known as the Peninsular 
2 CONT War. Napoleon appeared briefly and scored victories, but after his 
2 CONT departure the fighting continued for five years, with the British backing 
2 CONT Spanish armies and guerrillas. The Peninsular War cost France 300,000 
2 CONT casualties and untold sums of money and contributed to the eventual 
2 CONT weakening of the Napoleonic empire. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1809 Napoleon beat the Austrians again at Wagram, annexed the Illyrian 
2 CONT Provinces (now part of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 
2 CONT Yugoslavia), and abolished the Papal States. He also divorced Joséphine, 
2 CONT and in 1810 he married the Habsburg archduchess Marie Louise (1791-1847), 
2 CONT daughter of the Austrian emperor. By thus linking his dynasty with the 
2 CONT oldest ruling house in Europe, he hoped that his son, who was born in 
2 CONT 1811, would be more readily accepted by established monarchs. In 1810 
2 CONT also, the empire reached its widest extension with the annexation of 
2 CONT Bremen, Lübeck, and other parts of north Germany, together with the entire 
2 CONT kingdom of Holland, following the forced abdication of Louis Bonaparte. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Napoleonic Rule in Europe
2 CONT 
2 CONT In all the new kingdoms created by the emperor, the Code Napoléon was 
2 CONT established as law. Feudalism and serfdom were abolished, and freedom of 
2 CONT religion established (except in Spain). Each state was granted a 
2 CONT constitution, providing for universal male suffrage and a parliament and 
2 CONT containing a bill of rights. French-style administrative and judicial 
2 CONT systems were required. Schools were put under centralized administration, 
2 CONT and free public schools were envisioned. Higher education was opened to 
2 CONT all who qualified, regardless of class or religion. Every state had an 
2 CONT academy or institute for the promotion of the arts and sciences. Incomes 
2 CONT were provided for eminent scholars, especially scientists. Constitutional 
2 CONT government remained only a promise, but progress and increased efficiency 
2 CONT were widely realized. Not until after Napoleon's fall did the common 
2 CONT people of Europe, alienated from his governments by war taxes and military 
2 CONT conscription, fully appreciate the benefits he had given them. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Napoleon's Downfall
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1812 Napoleon, whose alliance with Alexander I had disintegrated, 
2 CONT launched an invasion of Russia that ended in a disastrous retreat from 
2 CONT Moscow. Thereafter all Europe united against him, and although he fought 
2 CONT on, and brilliantly, the odds were impossible. In April 1814, his marshals 
2 CONT refused to continue the struggle. After the allies had rejected his 
2 CONT stepping down in favor of his son, Napoleon abdicated unconditionally and 
2 CONT was exiled to the Mediterranean island of Elba. Marie Louise and his son 
2 CONT were put in the custody of her father, the emperor of Austria. Napoleon 
2 CONT never saw either of them again. Napoleon himself, however, soon made a 
2 CONT dramatic comeback. In March 1815, he escaped from Elba, reached France, 
2 CONT and marched on Paris, winning over the troops sent to capture him. In 
2 CONT Paris, he promulgated a new and more democratic constitution, and veterans 
2 CONT of his old campaigns flocked to his support. Napoleon asked peace of the 
2 CONT allies, but they outlawed him, and he decided to strike first. The result 
2 CONT was a campaign into Belgium, which ended in defeat at the Battle of 
2 CONT Waterloo on June 18, 1815. In Paris, crowds begged him to fight on, but 
2 CONT the politicians withdrew their support. Napoleon fled to Rochefort, where 
2 CONT he surrendered to the captain of the British battleship Bellerophon. He 
2 CONT was then exiled to Saint Helena, a remote island in the south Atlantic 
2 CONT Ocean, where he remained until his death from stomach cancer. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT The Napoleonic Legend
2 CONT 
2 CONT The cult of Napoleon as the man of destiny began during his lifetime. In 
2 CONT fact, he had begun to cultivate it during his first Italian campaign by 
2 CONT systematically publicizing his victories. As first consul and emperor, he 
2 CONT had engaged the best writers and artists of France and Europe to glorify 
2 CONT his deeds and had contributed to the cult himself by the elaborate 
2 CONT ceremonies with which he celebrated his rule, picturing himself as the 
2 CONT architect of France's greatest glory. He maintained that he had preserved 
2 CONT the achievements of the Revolution in France and offered their benefits to 
2 CONT Europe. His goal, he said, was to found a European state a federation of 
2 CONT free peoples. Whatever the truth of this, he became the arch-hero of the 
2 CONT French and a martyr to the world. In 1840 his remains were returned to 
2 CONT Paris at the request of King Louis-Philippe and interred with great pomp 
2 CONT and ceremony in the Invalides, where they still lie. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Evaluation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Napoleon's influence is evident in France even today. Reminders of him dot 
2 CONT Paris the most obvious being the Arc de Triomphe, the centerpiece of the 
2 CONT city, which was built to commemorate his victories. His spirit pervades 
2 CONT the constitution of the Fifth Republic; the country's basic law is still 
2 CONT the Code Napoléon, and the administrative and judicial systems are 
2 CONT essentially Napoleonic. A uniform state-regulated system of education 
2 CONT persists. Napoleon's radical reforms in all parts of Europe cultivated the 
2 CONT ground for the revolutions of the 19th century. Today, the impact of the 
2 CONT Code Napoléon is apparent in the law of all European countries. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Napoleon was a driven man, never secure, never satisfied. "Power is my 
2 CONT mistress," he said. His life was work-centered; even his social activities 
2 CONT had a purpose. He could bear amusements or vacations only briefly. His 
2 CONT tastes were for coarse food, bad wine, cheap snuff. He could be charming 
2 CONT hypnotically so for a purpose. He had intense loyalties to his family and 
2 CONT old associates. Nothing and no one, however, were allowed to interfere 
2 CONT with his work. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Napoleon was sometimes a tyrant and always an authoritarian, but one who 
2 CONT believed in ruling by mandate of the people, expressed in plebiscites. He 
2 CONT was also a great enlightened monarch a civil executive of enormous 
2 CONT capacity who changed French institutions and tried to reform the 
2 CONT institutions of Europe and give the Continent a common law. Few deny that 
2 CONT he was a military genius. At St. Helena, he said, Waterloo will erase the 
2 CONT memory of all my victories. He was wrong; for better or worse, he is best 
2 CONT remembered as a general, not for his enlightened government, but the 
2 CONT latter must be counted if he is justly to be called Napoleon the Great.

1 NOTE He revived the Napoleonic Empire in the mid-19th century and led France to 
2 CONT defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was born in Paris, on April 20, 1808, the 
2 CONT third and last son of King Louis and Queen Hortense (1783-1837) of 
2 CONT Holland, and thus a nephew of Napoleon I. Because the Bonaparte family was 
2 CONT banished from France after his uncle's downfall, Louis Napoleon was 
2 CONT educated privately in Switzerland and Bavaria. His mother schooled him in 
2 CONT the glories of the Napoleonic legend and set his course toward the 
2 CONT recovery of family power. Toward that end, he wrote pamphlets and 
2 CONT treatises to advertise himself and formulate a political program, 
2 CONT portraying himself as social reformer, political liberal, military expert, 
2 CONT and proponent of agricultural and industrial development. He also led two 
2 CONT unsuccessful armed attempts to overthrow the regime of King Louis 
2 CONT Philippe, in 1836 and 1840. Imprisoned for life after the latter, he 
2 CONT managed to escape in 1846, calling renewed attention to himself. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Leadership of France
2 CONT 
2 CONT Once Louis Philippe was ousted in 1848, Louis Napoleon renewed his quest 
2 CONT by offering himself as a candidate for the presidency of the new French 
2 CONT republic. To the astonishment of political veterans, he won in a 
2 CONT landslide. His triumph was diminished, however, by a Royalist victory in 
2 CONT the legislative elections in 1849 and by the constitution's limiting him 
2 CONT to one 4-year term. He resolved that dilemma by a coup d'état on December 
2 CONT 2, 1851, assuming dictatorial powers and extending his term of office to 
2 CONT ten years. Despite continued pockets of opposition, clear evidence of 
2 CONT widespread popular support encouraged him a year later to convert the 
2 CONT Second Republic into the Second Empire; because Napoleon I's son (died 
2 CONT 1832) had been known to his followers as Napoleon II, he took the title 
2 CONT Napoleon III. Historians divide his reign into two periods. The 
2 CONT dictatorship persisted until 1860; thereafter he began a series of liberal 
2 CONT reforms that culminated in a limited monarchy, the Liberal Empire, on 
2 CONT January 2, 1870. This liberalization was marked by labor legislation, a 
2 CONT movement toward free trade, and a revival of opposition parties. Perhaps 
2 CONT Napoleon III's most durable work was the reconstruction of Paris. His 
2 CONT successes, however, were overshadowed by a foreign policy that was too 
2 CONT often idealistic, blinding the emperor to real dangers to French security. 
2 CONT The threat from Prussia, in particular, was perceived too late and caught 
2 CONT the French unprepared in every respect when war came in 1870. Swift defeat 
2 CONT in the field led to Napoleon's capture, and his regime was overthrown in 
2 CONT Paris on September 4, 1870. He died in exile.
2 CONT     
2 CONT Evaluation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Napoleon III's reputation in France collapsed in the aftermath of the 
2 CONT shocking defeat and has never entirely recovered. The reevaluation of his 
2 CONT place in history has been more the work of foreign historians, untouched 
2 CONT by the national humiliation of 1870, who recognized his good intentions. 
2 CONT His place in history will ultimately depend upon whether his social and 
2 CONT economic goals are deemed necessary and desirable. His despotism now 
2 CONT appears to have been relatively benevolent, and the responsibility for 
2 CONT military failure in 1870 is no longer attributed to him alone.

1 NOTE Frederick II (Holy Roman Empire) (1194-1250), Holy Roman emperor (1215-50) 
2 CONT and as Frederick I, king of Sicily (1198-1212). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Born in Lesi, Italy, on December 26, 1194, Frederick was the son of Henry 
2 CONT VI and grandson of Frederick I, Holy Roman emperor. He was made German 
2 CONT king in 1196 and on the death of his father two years later became king of 
2 CONT Sicily. When his mother, Constance of Sicily (1146-98), acting as regent, 
2 CONT died several months later, the four-year-old prince was placed under the 
2 CONT guardianship of Pope Innocent III, the new regent of Sicily. Emperor Otto 
2 CONT IV was deposed in 1211, and the German princes selected Frederick to 
2 CONT replace him. A contest for the imperial throne ensued, because Otto was 
2 CONT unwilling to relinquish the crown. Supported by the papacy, to which he 
2 CONT promised many concessions, and aided by the French, Frederick was 
2 CONT eventually secure in his title. He was crowned king of Germany at 
2 CONT Aix-la-Chapelle (now Aachen, Germany) in 1215 and Holy Roman emperor at 
2 CONT Rome in 1220. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT On his coronation Frederick made a number of elaborate promises to the 
2 CONT church, including a vow that he would go on a Crusade. He postponed the 
2 CONT Crusade, however, because of an outbreak of anarchy in Sicily and because 
2 CONT of the resistance of the Lombard cities, which in 1226 renewed the Lombard 
2 CONT League, originally formed against his grandfather, Frederick I. The 
2 CONT following year Frederick annulled the Treaty of Constance and put the 
2 CONT Lombard cities under the ban of the empire. Threatened several times with 
2 CONT excommunication if he did not fulfill his coronation pledge, Frederick 
2 CONT determined to sail for Jerusalem in 1227. An epidemic forced him to return 
2 CONT three days after his departure, whereupon Pope Gregory IX declared him 
2 CONT excommunicated. In 1228 Frederick led the Fifth Crusade to the Holy Land, 
2 CONT where he took Jerusalem and concluded a 10-year truce with the sultan of 
2 CONT Egypt. Having married Yolande (1212-28?), the young daughter of the 
2 CONT titular king of Jerusalem, John of Brienne, and having assumed his title 
2 CONT upon her death, Frederick was crowned king of Jerusalem in that city in 
2 CONT 1229. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT He returned to Europe and spent many of his remaining years attempting to 
2 CONT bring the Lombards under subjection. During intermittent struggles with 
2 CONT the papacy he was excommunicated twice again, by Pope Gregory IX in 1239 
2 CONT and in 1245 by Pope Innocent IV. His participation in costly wars in Italy 
2 CONT caused him to neglect the welfare of his German subjects. Frederick 
2 CONT managed to establish peace, prosperity, and order in Sicily, however, 
2 CONT promulgating there in 1231 a comprehensive code of laws, described as the 
2 CONT best issued by any Western ruler since the reign of Charlemagne. Frederick 
2 CONT also made worthy contributions to learning in Italy. Because he was a man 
2 CONT of culture, he gathered scholars and men of letters at his Sicilian court, 
2 CONT which Dante called the birthplace of Italian poetry. The University of 
2 CONT Naples was founded by Frederick in 1224. For about a century after his 
2 CONT death, on December 13, 1250, the belief persisted that Frederick was still 
2 CONT alive. According to one famous legend, Frederick resides in a cave in the 
2 CONT Kyffhäuser Mountains, in the region of Thuringia, awaiting the summons of 
2 CONT the German people to return and restore peace in the empire. The legend 
2 CONT was later interpreted to refer to Frederick I.

1 NOTE Frederick I (Holy Roman Empire), called Frederick Barbarossa (1123?-90), 
2 CONT Holy Roman emperor and king of Germany (1152-90), king of Italy (1155-90), 
2 CONT and as Frederick III, duke of Swabia (1147-52, 1167-68). He was born in 
2 CONT Waiblingen, the son of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia 
2 CONT (1090-1147), and the nephew of Conrad III, king of Germany. Conrad III, 
2 CONT favoring Frederick over his own son, on his deathbed recommended to the 
2 CONT German princes that Frederick be chosen for the German kingship and the 
2 CONT imperial throne. Accordingly, after the death of his uncle in 1152, 
2 CONT Frederick Barbarossa was made German king and elected Holy Roman emperor. 
2 CONT He conceived of his imperial title as a grant from God, through the German 
2 CONT princes, and wished to restore the glory of the Roman Empire. He 
2 CONT consequently decided to consolidate the imperial position in Germany and 
2 CONT Italy and began by issuing a general order for peace among the princes of 
2 CONT Germany, at the same time granting them extensive concessions. In 1154 he 
2 CONT proceeded to Italy, where he received the Lombard crown at Pavia. The 
2 CONT following year he was crowned Holy Roman emperor by Pope Adrian IV, whose 
2 CONT authority Frederick had reinstated before his coronation. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1156 Pope Adrian aroused Frederick against the papacy by implying in a 
2 CONT letter to him that the emperor held lands only as a fief from the pope. 
2 CONT Two years later Frederick incurred the hostility of the Lombards by 
2 CONT demanding recognition of all his royal rights, including his power to 
2 CONT appoint the imperial podesta, or governor, in every town. Such cities as 
2 CONT Milan, Piacenza, Brescia, and Crema considered that demand a denial of 
2 CONT their communal liberties and in 1158 began a struggle that lasted until 
2 CONT 1183 and required Frederick to lead five expeditions to Italy. Between 
2 CONT 1158 and 1162 Frederick warred with Milan and its allies, subduing that 
2 CONT city and confirming claims to other Italian cities. Meanwhile Frederick 
2 CONT had set up a series of antipopes in opposition to the reigning pope, 
2 CONT Alexander III, who espoused the cause of the Milanese and their allies and 
2 CONT who, in 1165, excommunicated Frederick. By attacking the Leonine City in 
2 CONT Rome in 1167-68, Frederick was able to install one of the antipopes, 
2 CONT Paschal III (died 1168), on the papal throne. The Lombard League, 
2 CONT consisting of the cities of Milan, Parma, Padua, Verona, Piacenza, 
2 CONT Bologna, Cremona, Mantua, Bergamo, and Brescia, was formed in 1167 and 
2 CONT eventually acknowledged Pope Alexander as leader. During the next seven 
2 CONT years the league acquired military strength, rebuilt Milan, constructed 
2 CONT the fortress city of Alessandria, and organized a federal system of 
2 CONT administration. The fifth expedition (1174-76) of Frederick to Italy 
2 CONT terminated in defeat by the Lombard League at Legnano. The defeat was 
2 CONT significant in military history, because it was the first major triumph of 
2 CONT infantry over a mounted army of feudal knights. Frederick was forced in 
2 CONT 1177 to acknowledge Alexander III as pope and in 1183 to sign the Peace of 
2 CONT Constance, acceding to the demands of the Lombards for autonomy but 
2 CONT retaining imperial suzerainty over the towns. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although imperial control in Italy was virtually ended by his defeat at 
2 CONT Legnano, Frederick managed to enhance his prestige in central Europe. He 
2 CONT made Poland tributary to the empire, raised Bohemia to the rank of a 
2 CONT kingdom, and erected the margravate of Austria into an independent 
2 CONT hereditary duchy. His own power as emperor in Germany was firmly 
2 CONT established in 1180, when he ended his long struggle with the Welfs by 
2 CONT putting down a revolt led by the Welf Henry the Lion and depriving him of 
2 CONT most of his lands. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Frederick initiated the Third Crusade in 1189, and in the next year, 
2 CONT having resigned the government of the empire to his son Henry, later Holy 
2 CONT Roman Emperor Henry VI, set out for Asia Minor. After gaining two great 
2 CONT victories over the Muslims at Philomelion (now Ak³ehir) and Iconium (now 
2 CONT Konya), he was drowned in the Calycadnus (now Göksu) River in Cilicia (now 
2 CONT in Turkey) on June 10, 1190.

2 CONT Italy, arriving there about 1046. After serving in the forces of the 
2 CONT prince of Capua, he organized an army to secure possessions for himself in 
2 CONT Calabria. When Pope Leo IX attempted to expel the Normans from Italy in 
2 CONT 1053, Guiscard played an important role in defeating the papal forces at 
2 CONT Civitate, near the modern city of San Severo. After the death of his older 
2 CONT brother Humphrey Guiscard (died 1057), Robert became leader of the Normans 
2 CONT in Italy. The pope, seeking independence from the Holy Roman Empire, 
2 CONT decided to enlist the Normans as allies. In 1059 Pope Nicholas II 
2 CONT (980?-1061) created Robert by the Grace of God and Saint Peter, duke of 
2 CONT Apulia and Calabria and, with their help, hereafter of Sicily. In return, 
2 CONT Robert acknowledged the pope as his feudal overlord. Sicily was in 
2 CONT Byzantine hands at the time and so Robert and his brother Roger (Roger I) 
2 CONT embarked on a series of campaigns, capturing Messina in 1061 and Palermo 
2 CONT in 1072. Turning his attention to the Balkans in 1081, Robert gained a 
2 CONT great victory over the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus at Durrës, 
2 CONT Albania. His campaigns at Macedonia and Thessalía were being carried on, 
2 CONT meanwhile, by his son Bohemond I. Robert was recalled from his victorious 
2 CONT campaigns in 1085 to go to the aid of Pope Gregory VII, who was besieged 
2 CONT in the castle of Sant'Angelo by Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV. Robert drove 
2 CONT Henry from Rome, and reduced one-third of the city to ashes. Because of 
2 CONT the unpopularity of Gregory VII in Rome, he took the pope to Monte 
2 CONT Cassino. Robert then went to the support of Bohemond in the Greek 
2 CONT campaign, but died of fever at Kefallinía a few weeks later.

2 CONT Bohemond distinguished himself in a war (1081-85) against the Byzantine

2 CONT divided between Bohemond and his brother. Bohemond joined the First 
2 CONT Crusade to try to extend his possessions. As long as he remained with the 
2 CONT Crusaders, Bohemond was their leader, although he was not officially 
2 CONT recognized as such. Antioch was captured in June 1098, and Bohemond 
2 CONT received it as a principality. He was captured by the Muslims in 1100 and 
2 CONT held prisoner until 1103. After suffering a great defeat the following 
2 CONT year, he returned to western Europe to seek help. During his stay in 
2 CONT France, he married the daughter of King Philip I of France. By 1107 he was 
2 CONT head of a large army of adventurers who had been attracted by his military 
2 CONT renown, but instead of returning to Antioch, he led his forces against the 
2 CONT Byzantine Empire, which had restricted the expansion of his principality 
2 CONT after 1098. His attack was unsuccessful, and Bohemond was forced to accept

1 NOTE Victor Emmanuel II (1820-78), king of Sardinia (1849-61) and king of Italy 
2 CONT (1861-78), born on March 14, 1820, in Turin. He was the son of Charles 
2 CONT Albert (1798-1849), king of Sardinia (1831-49), who abdicated in his favor 
2 CONT after being defeated by the Austrians at the Battle of Novara in 1849. 
2 CONT Assisted by Italian statesman Conte Camillo Benso di Cavour, his premier, 
2 CONT Victor Emmanuel developed parliamentary government, reorganized the army, 
2 CONT regulated finances, stimulated commerce and industry, and secularized 
2 CONT ecclesiastical property. He assisted (1855-56) Great Britain and France in 
2 CONT the Crimean War. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Victor Emmanuel strongly supported the movement toward national unity that 
2 CONT was growing in Italy at this time. With French aid he repulsed the 
2 CONT Austrians when they invaded Piedmont in 1859 and added Lombardy to his 
2 CONT realm. The central Italian states accepted him as their king, and after 
2 CONT the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi captured the Kingdom of the Two 
2 CONT Sicilies from the French in 1860-61, Victor Emmanuel was master of the 
2 CONT entire peninsula, with the exception of Venetia, still held by the 
2 CONT Austrians, and the Papal States. He was proclaimed king of Italy in 1861. 
2 CONT In the same year he ceded Nice and Savoy to France in payment for past and 
2 CONT promised French aid. Venetia was won as a result of Italian intervention 
2 CONT on the Prussian side in the Seven Weeks' War between Austria and Prussia 
2 CONT in 1866. In 1870 Rome was annexed and made the capital of Italy. Victor 
2 CONT Emmanuel then devoted himself to the peaceful development of Italy. He 
2 CONT died in Rome on January 9, 1878.

1 NOTE Peter the Great or Peter I (1672-1725), czar of Russia (1682-1725), whose 
2 CONT military campaigns and modernization efforts transformed Russia into an 
2 CONT empire to be reckoned with in European affairs. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Peter was born in Moscow on June 9, 1672, the son of Czar Alexis I 
2 CONT Mikhailovich. In early childhood he was taught by private tutors; later, 
2 CONT with the aid of palace masters and various foreigners living in Moscow, he 
2 CONT taught himself technical and mechanical arts, especially in relation to 
2 CONT military and naval science. From 1682 to 1689, under the regency of his 
2 CONT half sister Sophia Alekseyevna (1657-1704), Peter shared the throne with 
2 CONT his older half brother Ivan V (1666-96), but in 1689 Peter's partisans at 
2 CONT court overthrew Sophia and installed him as sole authority (formally, Ivan 
2 CONT continued to reign until his death). 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During Peter's reign Russia emerged as a great European power, in part 
2 CONT because of his introduction of many Western European scientific, 
2 CONT technological, cultural, and political conceptions and practices. In 1696, 
2 CONT after creating a river fleet, the first Russian navy, Peter captured from 
2 CONT the Turks the important fortress of Azov, which commanded the Sea of Azov 
2 CONT and gave Russia access to the Black Sea. The following year, in an effort 
2 CONT to secure allies among the European powers against the Turks and the 
2 CONT Swedes and in order to acquaint himself with Western technology, Peter 
2 CONT accompanied a diplomatic mission to the principal capitals of Western 
2 CONT Europe. During his travels he induced about 900 artisans, craftsmen, 
2 CONT technical advisers, and other experts to emigrate to Russia. Later he sent 
2 CONT many young Russians abroad to learn Western crafts and trades. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT On his return to Moscow in 1698 Peter, determined to gain control of the 
2 CONT eastern part of the Baltic Sea, began military preparations for an attack 
2 CONT on Sweden. Although the Great Northern War (1700-21) that ensued began 
2 CONT inauspiciously for him, with a devastating setback at Narva (1700), he 
2 CONT went on to win one of the greatest military victories in Russian history 
2 CONT at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. By the terms of the Treaty of Nystadt 
2 CONT (1721) that concluded the war, Russia gained control of a considerable 
2 CONT area of the Baltic littoral, later called the Baltic Provinces. In 1703, 
2 CONT during the war, Peter founded Saint Petersburg as a window to Europe and 
2 CONT made it his capital. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Peter was proclaimed emperor in 1721 and thus established the Russian 
2 CONT Empire. He introduced such internal reforms as abolition of the power of 
2 CONT the boyars, or aristocrats, and the subordination of those nobles and of 
2 CONT the church to the throne; the encouragement of industry, trade, and 
2 CONT education; and the reorganization of the administrative apparatus of the 
2 CONT state to make it more modern and efficient. During Peter's reign the 
2 CONT Russian alphabet was simplified, Arabic numerals were introduced, the 
2 CONT first newspaper in the Russian language was published, schools were 
2 CONT founded, and an Academy of Sciences was established. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Under Peter, Russia became a regimented state. His police-state philosophy 
2 CONT was based on the conviction that, just as he spent his life unceasingly in 
2 CONT service for the state, so his subjects, whose welfare was his object, 
2 CONT should discharge their obligation to the state. Both his reforms and his 
2 CONT swift, often cruel, reprisals for infractions of his regulations made 
2 CONT indelible impressions upon Russian life. He died in St. Petersburg on 
2 CONT February 8, 1725.

1 NOTE Catherine I, real name Marta Skavronskaya (1682?-1727), empress of Russia 
2 CONT (1725-27). Of peasant origin, she was born in Jakobstadt (now Jèkabpils, 
2 CONT Latvia) but was orphaned early in life and reared by a pastor in 
2 CONT Marienburg (now Malbork, Poland). When the Russians captured Marienburg in 
2 CONT 1702, she was taken prisoner by the Russian commander, who sold her to 
2 CONT Prince Aleksandr Menshikov (1673-1729), a close adviser of Peter the 
2 CONT Great. She soon became Peter's mistress and most influential counselor. 
2 CONT Peter, who had divorced his first wife in 1699, married Catherine in 1712. 
2 CONT After his son Alexis (1690-1718) died, Peter issued an ukaz (imperial 
2 CONT order) declaring his right to name his own successor; he died in 1725 
2 CONT without doing so. Catherine, however, had been crowned empress-consort in 
2 CONT 1724, and on Peter's death she was proclaimed his successor; the claims of 
2 CONT Alexis's son (later Peter III) were bypassed. Shrewd and courageous, 
2 CONT Catherine defended Peter's advisers against his rages, and in her own 
2 CONT reign she established, and concentrated power in, the supreme privy 
2 CONT council. Two of her eight children by Peter survived, Anna (mother of 
2 CONT Peter III) and Elizabeth Petrovna (empress 1741-62).

2 CONT became empress in 1741 by staging a palace revolution that deposed the 
2 CONT infant emperor Ivan VI (1740-64) and his mother Anna Leopoldovna 
2 CONT (1718-46), who acted as regent. In 1743 Elizabeth won a historic

1 NOTE He was a commander for King Duncan I, and a chieftain of the Moray 
2 CONT district. After murdering Duncan in 1040, Macbeth claimed the kingdom and 
2 CONT ruled for 17 prosperous years. In 1057 he was killed in battle by Malcolm 
2 CONT Canmore (1031?-93), a son of Duncan I who was later, as Malcolm III, king 
2 CONT of Scotland. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Macbeth, a tragedy in five acts written by Shakespeare, is based on the 
2 CONT career of King Macbeth. Possibly performed as early as 1606, the play was 
2 CONT first printed in the edition of Shakespeare's works that was published in 
2 CONT 1623 and is known as the First Folio. The principal source used by the 
2 CONT author for this work was Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland 
2 CONT (1577) by the English chronicler Raphael Holinshed. The tragedy is a 
2 CONT penetrating, concentrated, and harrowing study of ambition. In the 
2 CONT characters of Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, the play provides two 
2 CONT strong roles long regarded as attractive vehicles for the leading actors 
2 CONT of the world. Shakespeare's tragedy also provided the basis for the 
2 CONT libretto of the opera Macbeth (1847) by the Italian composer Giuseppe 
2 CONT Verdi.

1 NOTE Canute conquered England in 1013. When his father died the following year, 
2 CONT he was proclaimed king of England by his Danish warriors. However, the 
2 CONT witenagemot, an advisory body to the Anglo-Saxon kings, reinstated King 
2 CONT Æthelred, and Canute fled. He returned in 1015 and soon subjugated all of 
2 CONT England, except London. After Æthelred's death in 1016, the Londoners 
2 CONT named his son, Eadmund II, king. During an ensuing struggle, the Londoners 
2 CONT were defeated at Ashingdon, Essex, in October 1016. The following month 
2 CONT Eadmund died and Canute emerged the undisputed king. A wise and effective 
2 CONT ruler, he reconciled with the English and maintained peace with the 
2 CONT Continental powers. To that end he married King Æthelred's widow, 
2 CONT supported the church, and in 1027 went to Rome for the coronation of Holy 
2 CONT Roman Emperor Conrad II. For administrative purposes he divided England 
2 CONT into the four earldoms of Mercia, Northumberland, Wessex, and East Anglia. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Canute continued to reside in England even after he inherited the crown of 
2 CONT Denmark in 1018. He soon began his conflict with Olaf II of Norway, whose 
2 CONT realm he claimed. Forcing Olaf into exile in 1028, Canute installed his 
2 CONT young son, Svegn (reigned 1029-35; died 1036), to govern Norway; after 
2 CONT Olaf's fall at Stiklestad in 1030 his rule was unchallenged. Canute's 
2 CONT North Sea empire fell apart after his death. Two sons separately ascended 
2 CONT the thrones of England and Denmark, while the son of Olaf II succeeded in 
2 CONT Norway.

1 NOTE Egbert (775?-839), king of Wessex (802-39), and the first Saxon king 
2 CONT recognized as sovereign of all England (828-39). He was the son of a 
2 CONT Kentish noble but claimed descent from Cerdic (reigned 519-34), founder of 
2 CONT Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons in southern England. During the 
2 CONT late 8th century, when King Offa of Mercia (reigned 757-96) ruled most of 
2 CONT England, Egbert lived in exile at the court of Charlemagne. Egbert 
2 CONT regained his kingdom in 802. He conquered the neighboring kingdoms of 
2 CONT Kent, Cornwall, and Mercia, and by 830 he was also acknowledged as 
2 CONT sovereign of East Anglia, Sussex, Surrey, and Northumbria and was given 
2 CONT the title of Bretwalda (Anglo-Saxon, ruler of the British). During 
2 CONT succeeding years Egbert led expeditions against the Welsh and the Vikings. 
2 CONT The year before his death he defeated a combined force of Danes and Welsh 
2 CONT at Hingston Down in Cornwall. He was succeeded by his son Ethelwulf 
2 CONT (825-58), the father of Alfred.

1 NOTE He is one of the outstanding figures of English history. On the death of 
2 CONT his brother Æthelred Alfred became king, coming to the throne during a 
2 CONT Danish invasion. Although he succeeded in making peace with the Danes, 
2 CONT they resumed their marauding expeditions five years later, and by early 
2 CONT 878 they were successful almost everywhere. About Easter of 878, however, 
2 CONT Alfred established himself at Athelney and began assembling an army. In 
2 CONT the middle of that year he defeated the Danes and captured their 
2 CONT stronghold, probably at present-day Edington. During the following 14 
2 CONT years Alfred was able to devote himself to the internal affairs of his 
2 CONT kingdom. By 886 he had captured the city of London, and soon afterward he 
2 CONT was recognized as the king of all England. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 893 the Danes invaded England again, and the following four years were 
2 CONT marked by warfare; eventually, the Danes were forced to withdraw from 
2 CONT Alfred's domain. The only ruler to resist Danish invasions successfully, 
2 CONT Alfred made his kingdom the rallying point for all Saxons, thus laying the 
2 CONT foundation for the unification of England. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Alfred was a patron of learning and did much for the education of his 
2 CONT people. He began a court school and invited British and foreign scholars, 
2 CONT notably the Welsh monk Asser (flourished 885-909) and the Irish-born 
2 CONT philosopher and theologian John Scotus Erigena, to come there. Alfred 
2 CONT translated such works as The Consolation of Philosophy by the Roman 
2 CONT statesman and philosopher Boethius, The History of the World by the 
2 CONT Spanish priest Paulus Orosius (circa 385-420), and Pastoral Care by Pope 
2 CONT Gregory I. Alfred's laws, the first promulgated in more than a century, 
2 CONT were the first that made no distinction between the English and the Welsh 
2 CONT peoples.

1 NOTE The first monarch to take the title of king of England. The grandson of 
2 CONT King Alfred, he was crowned at Kingston-upon-Thames and seems to have 
2 CONT possessed both great ambition and talent. It is supposed that his design 
2 CONT was to unite, under his personal rule, the entire island of Britain. On 
2 CONT the death of his brother-in-law Sihtric (reigned about 921-26), king of 
2 CONT Northumbria, about 926, Athelstan took possession of his dominions. The 
2 CONT other kings of the island submitted to him, in some instances voluntarily, 
2 CONT and he styled himself Rex totius Britanniae (King of all Britain). A 
2 CONT league, composed of Welsh, Scottish, and Danish allies, was formed against 
2 CONT him. A fierce and decisive battle was fought (937) at Brunanburh, in which 
2 CONT the allies were utterly defeated. After this the renown of Athelstan 
2 CONT spread to the Continent. He exhibited a deep interest in the welfare of 
2 CONT his people, improved the laws, and encouraged the translation of the Bible 
2 CONT into the vernacular.

2 CONT negotiated unsuccessfully with the Byzantine emperor Nicephorus II Phocas 
2 CONT (913?-69) for an alliance between the Byzantine and Holy Roman empires,

1 NOTE During most of the rule of the Danish kings of England who followed Canute 
2 CONT II, Edward lived at the court of the dukes of Normandy. In 1041, 
2 CONT Hardecanute invited Edward to England, and the following year Edward 
2 CONT succeeded to the English throne, largely because of the support of Godwin, 
2 CONT earl of Wessex (990?-1053). Edward married Godwin's daughter, but soon 
2 CONT gave his favor to the enemies of Godwin, who was harassed and for a brief 
2 CONT time exiled. Perhaps because of Godwin's popularity in England, a 
2 CONT reconciliation was effected about 1052. Godwin's son Harold, later Harold 
2 CONT II of England, became one of Edward's advisers, and another son, Tostig, 
2 CONT became his favorite. In 1055, Edward made Tostig earl of Northumbria, but 
2 CONT the earl's rule was so oppressive that a rebellion broke out in 1065, and 
2 CONT Edward was forced to exile him. Thereafter, Edward's health failed, and he 
2 CONT was unable to attend the consecration of Westminster Abbey, which he had 
2 CONT founded. He was succeeded by Harold II, the last Saxon king of England. 
2 CONT Less than a century after his death, Edward was canonized.

2 CONT great-grandson of King Harold I, he was brought up in Russia and later 
2 CONT participated in numerous Viking raids along the Baltic and North Sea 
2 CONT coasts and in the British Isles. During his last campaign, in England 
2 CONT (994) with Sweyn I Forkbeard of Denmark, he was converted to Christianity, 
2 CONT and the following year he returned to Norway, where a rebellion had 
2 CONT erupted against the pagan Earl Håkon (937?-95). The victorious Olaf 
2 CONT founded the city of Nidaros (now Trondheim) as his capital and set out to 
2 CONT Christianize the country. Only partly successful in Norway, his efforts 
2 CONT contributed to the conversion of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faeroe 
2 CONT Islands to Christianity. Olaf's forces were defeated by a coalition 
2 CONT consisting of Sweyn Forkbeard, King Olaf of Sweden (died 1022?), and the 
2 CONT two sons of Earl Håkon in the naval Battle of Svold (1000), during which 
2 CONT Olaf lost his life.

2 CONT Germany, he contended with domestic rebellions. Henry supported the

1 NOTE He was the last of the Saxon rulers, and a capable military leader. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Harold was made earl of East Anglia in 1045. In 1051 Godwin lost the favor 
2 CONT of King Edward the Confessor and was exiled with his sons, but the 
2 CONT following year the lands and titles of the family were restored in order 
2 CONT to strengthen the security of the country. In 1053 Harold succeeded his 
2 CONT father as earl of Wessex, becoming chief minister to King Edward and the 
2 CONT most powerful man in the realm. Through his efforts, the warlike Welsh 
2 CONT were subdued in 1063. After a revolt against Harold's brother Tostig, earl 
2 CONT of Northumbria, Harold was forced to banish Tostig, an action that managed 
2 CONT to restore peace but created a bitter enmity between the two brothers. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Probably in 1064, Harold was shipwrecked off the coast of Normandy and 
2 CONT captured by William, duke of Normandy. In order to secure his release, 
2 CONT Harold was forced to swear that he would support William's claim to the 
2 CONT crown of England. King Edward had generally favored the Normans during his 
2 CONT lifetime, but when he was dying, he recommended that the throne be awarded 
2 CONT to Harold, whom the witenagemot (royal council) elected and crowned. 
2 CONT William immediately asserted his claim, which was supported by the 
2 CONT dispossessed Tostig and Harold III (Hard Ruler) of Norway. Tostig and his 
2 CONT Norwegian ally invaded Yorkshire and, after several military successes, 
2 CONT were routed by the English forces at Stamford Bridge on September 25, 
2 CONT 1066; both were killed. Three days later, William landed in Sussex with 
2 CONT his army, forcing Harold to rush southward to meet him. The armies engaged 
2 CONT at Senlac Hill on October 14, 1066, in the Battle of Hastings; the defeat 
2 CONT and death of Harold made William, thereafter called The Conqueror, ruler 
2 CONT of England as King William I.

2 CONT raiding the countryside near Alnwick, he was captured by the English, who 
2 CONT took him to Normandy. He was able to obtain his freedom only by assenting 
2 CONT to the Treaty of Falaise, which acknowledged Henry as overlord of 
2 CONT Scotland. In 1188 William secured a papal bull guaranteeing the 
2 CONT independence of the Scottish church from that of England, and in 1189 
2 CONT Henry's son Richard, who had succeeded him as king, annulled the Treaty of 
2 CONT Falaise, surrendering all claims to suzerainty over Scotland in return for 
2 CONT a large payment. William was succeeded by his son, Alexander II.

1 NOTE When Princess Margaret (1283?-90) died, he became a competitor for the 
2 CONT crown then claimed by Robert de Bruce VI (1210-95), grandfather of King 
2 CONT Robert I. Edward I of England was the arbiter in the dispute, and he chose 
2 CONT in favor of Baliol, who in turn pledged his fealty to Edward. Feeling that 
2 CONT his sovereignty was only nominal and resenting various indignities to 
2 CONT which he was subjected, Baliol in 1295 concluded an alliance with France, 
2 CONT which was at war with England. The English then invaded Scotland, defeated 
2 CONT the Scottish troops, took Baliol prisoner, and forced him to surrender his 
2 CONT crown on July 10, 1296. The name is also spelled Balliol.

1 NOTE He was liberator of Scotland.  He was originally named Robert de Bruce, 
2 CONT and to distinguish him from his father and grandfather, who had the same 
2 CONT name, he is often referred to as Robert de Bruce VIII. He is also called 
2 CONT Robert the Bruce. As earl of Carrick he paid homage to King Edward I of 
2 CONT England, who, in 1296, defeated King John de Baliol and thereafter refused 
2 CONT to acknowledge another king of Scotland. Bruce later abandoned Edward's 
2 CONT cause and joined other Scottish leaders in taking up arms for the 
2 CONT independence of his country. In 1299, the year after the Scottish patriot 
2 CONT Sir William Wallace was defeated by Edward at Falkirk, Bruce, then still 
2 CONT in favor with Edward, was made one of the four regents who ruled the 
2 CONT kingdom in the name of Baliol. In 1305 he was one of those consulted in 
2 CONT the decision to make Scotland a province of England. In 1306 he met an old 
2 CONT enemy, the Scottish patriot John Comyn (died 1306), who was the nephew of 
2 CONT Baliol; a quarrel occurred, and Bruce stabbed Comyn. Bruce proclaimed his 
2 CONT right to the throne, and on March 27, 1306, he was crowned king at Scone. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Bruce was deposed, however, in 1307 by Edward's army and forced to flee to 
2 CONT the highlands and then to the little island of Rathlin on the coast of 
2 CONT Antrim (now in Northern Ireland). In his absence all his estates were 
2 CONT confiscated, and he and his followers were excommunicated. He continued to 
2 CONT recruit followers, however, and in less than two years he wrested nearly 
2 CONT all of Scotland from the English. Bruce again defeated the English in 1314 
2 CONT in the Battle of Bannockburn (see Bannockburn, Battle of), twice invaded 
2 CONT England, and in 1323 concluded with King Edward II of England a truce for 
2 CONT 13 years. After the accession of King Edward III in 1327, war again broke 
2 CONT out, and the Scots won again. In 1328 they secured a treaty recognizing 
2 CONT the independence of Scotland and the right of Bruce to the throne. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In his later years Bruce was stricken with leprosy and lived in seclusion 
2 CONT at Cardross Castle, on the northern shore of the Firth of Clyde, where he 
2 CONT died. He was succeeded by his son, David II. Bruce's nephew, Robert II, 
2 CONT who succeeded David, was the first king of the Stuart house of English and 
2 CONT Scottish royalty. He also had 2 daughters with Elizabeth.

1 NOTE He succeeded his father at only five years of age, but soon after his 
2 CONT coronation (1331) he was deposed by Edward de Baliol, an English-backed 
2 CONT claimant to the throne. For the next eight years David lived in exile in 
2 CONT France. In 1341 he returned to Scotland, and five years later went to war 
2 CONT with England as an ally of France. The English defeated both the French 
2 CONT (at Crécy) and the Scots (at Neville's Cross, October 1346), taking David 
2 CONT prisoner and capturing large parts of Scotland and France. David remained 
2 CONT a prisoner in England for 11 years. In 1357 he was freed in return for the 
2 CONT promise of a ransom, and thereafter enjoyed friendly relations with the 
2 CONT English. David was succeeded by his nephew Robert II, founder of the 
2 CONT Stuart dynasty.

1 NOTE Robert II (of Scotland) (1316-90), king of Scotland (1371-90), and founder 
2 CONT of the Stuart dynasty in Scotland and England. His mother was Marjorie 
2 CONT (died 1316), daughter of the Scottish king Robert Bruce; his father was 
2 CONT Walter (died 1326), hereditary steward of Scotland, in charge of 
2 CONT administering the Crown revenues and the king's household. In 1318 the 
2 CONT Scottish parliament passed a decree providing that if Robert Bruce died 
2 CONT without sons, his grandson should be his successor; a son, later King 
2 CONT David II, was born to Bruce in 1324. In 1326 Robert succeeded his father 
2 CONT as steward of Scotland and in 1331 David was crowned king. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In the dynastic conflict that ensued between England and Scotland, David 
2 CONT was exiled to France in 1333 and Robert served as his regent until his 
2 CONT return in 1341. After the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346 David was 
2 CONT taken to England as a captive, and Robert again became regent. When David 
2 CONT returned, he accused Robert of desertion and named King Edward III of 
2 CONT England as his successor. Robert rebelled in 1363 and was captured and 
2 CONT imprisoned until shortly before David's death in 1371; he then became king 
2 CONT according to the provisions of the decree of 1318. During his reign, 
2 CONT Scotland was twice invaded by the English, in 1384 and in 1385. Because of 
2 CONT old age and infirmity, Robert did not aid the Scottish barons in resisting 
2 CONT these invasions, nor did he join in their retaliatory expedition against 
2 CONT the English in 1388. He also had a son and 5 daughters with Elizabeth and 
2 CONT 2 sons and 2 daughters with Euphemia.

2 CONT and king of Italy (844-75), the eldest son of Holy Roman Emperor Lothair 
2 CONT I. Louis was coemperor with his father from 850 to 855, when he became 
2 CONT sole emperor, but his authority was in fact confined to his Italian 
2 CONT kingdom. Although he was successful in some campaigns against the Saracen 
2 CONT invaders of Italy, he was constricted by the jealousies of local Italian 
2 CONT princes. He acquired much of Provence on the death of his brother Charles 
2 CONT (circa 845-63), but he was a weak ruler, and his empire declined.

2 CONT rent with wars between the towns and the nobles; the German princes 
2 CONT finally deposed him for drunkenness and incompetence in 1400, choosing 
2 CONT Rupert of the Palatinate (1352-1410) in his stead. In Bohemia Wenceslas 
2 CONT fared little better. Harried by relatives and rebellious nobles, he was 
2 CONT imprisoned in 1394 by his cousin Jobst (1351-1411), margrave of Moravia, 
2 CONT who compelled the king to name him regent in Bohemia. In 1402 he was again 
2 CONT imprisoned and temporarily deposed, this time by his younger brother 
2 CONT Sigismund. Wenceslas was an early supporter of the Czech religious 
2 CONT reformer John Huss (Jan Hus) but did nothing to save him from the stake in 
2 CONT 1415 and subsequently turned upon his followers.

1 NOTE Sigismund (1368-1437), Holy Roman emperor (1411-37) and king of Hungary 
2 CONT (1387-1437) and Bohemia (1419-37), the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles 
2 CONT IV. In 1385 he married Queen Mary of Hungary (1370-95), thus acceding to 
2 CONT the throne of Hungary two years later. In 1396 he led a great army of 
2 CONT Crusaders from many parts of Europe against the Turks; the latter, under 
2 CONT the Ottoman sultan Bayazid I, inflicted a crushing defeat upon Sigismund's 
2 CONT forces at Nicopolis (now Nikopol), Bulgaria. Upon the death of Holy Roman 
2 CONT Emperor Rupert (1352-1410), Sigismund was elected to succeed him, but he 
2 CONT did not receive formal coronation at the hands of the pope until 1433. In 
2 CONT 1414 Sigismund persuaded the antipope John XXIII to convoke the Council of 
2 CONT Constance at which a longstanding dispute over the papal succession was 
2 CONT settled and ecclesiastical reforms were instituted. The council also tried 
2 CONT the Bohemian religious reformer John Huss (Jan Hus) and condemned and 
2 CONT executed him as a heretic. Sigismund succeeded to the throne of Bohemia in 
2 CONT 1419. His power in Bohemia was never more than nominal, however, as the 
2 CONT Bohemians believed him guilty of complicity in the death of Huss and 
2 CONT repeatedly rose in arms against him.

1 NOTE He was the last of the Salian emperors, who enlarged the German Kingdom 
2 CONT and ended its civil war. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Fearing that his succession was endangered, Henry rebelled against his 
2 CONT father, Emperor Henry IV, in 1104, captured him, and forced him to 
2 CONT abdicate. The young Henry became undisputed ruler on the death of his 
2 CONT father in 1106. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1110 Henry agreed to respect the decree of Pope Paschal II against lay 
2 CONT investiture, that is, the king's right to confer symbols of authority on 
2 CONT church officials, providing that the pope would crown him and that the 
2 CONT church would surrender all its secular property and rights within the 
2 CONT empire. Because Henry's demand raised such a furor among the clergy when 
2 CONT it was announced to them on the day of coronation, Paschal refused to 
2 CONT crown Henry, who thereupon departed from Rome, taking the pope prisoner. 
2 CONT To gain his freedom, the pope allowed Henry the power of investiture and 
2 CONT crowned him emperor, but in 1112 he retracted his concessions. From 1114 
2 CONT to 1121 many of the German princes rebelled against Henry. Although 
2 CONT northern Germany was in revolt in 1116, Henry invaded Italy to seize the 
2 CONT territories that had been left to the papacy by Matilda, countess of 
2 CONT Tuscany (1046-1115). After driving Pope Paschal from Rome, Henry had 
2 CONT himself recrowned in 1117 by Maurice Bourdin, archbishop of Braga, whom he 
2 CONT established as the antipope Gregory VIII (died about 1137) after the death 
2 CONT of Paschal in 1118. Henry was accordingly excommunicated by Paschal's 
2 CONT successor, Pope Gelasius II (reigned 1118-19). 
2 CONT   
2 CONT On returning to Germany, Henry concluded peace with his former domestic 
2 CONT enemies at the Diet of Würzburg in 1121. By the Concordat of Worms in 1122 
2 CONT he established a compromise on investiture with the papacy, abandoning the 
2 CONT antipope Gregory VIII; he was then reinstated in the communion of the 
2 CONT church, but retained the right to appoint church officials. In the last 
2 CONT year of his reign the emperor, in alliance with his father-in-law, Henry I 
2 CONT of England, led an unsuccessful expedition against Louis VI of France. 
2 CONT Henry was succeeded by Lothair II.

1 NOTE Henry succeeded his father at the age of six, but during most of his 
2 CONT minority, his mother ruled in his name. After Henry came of age in 1065 he 
2 CONT crushed a rebellion in Saxony. About that time there began the struggle 
2 CONT between pope and emperor for temporal power in the empire. Despite a papal 
2 CONT decree prohibiting appointment of church officials by the emperor, Henry 
2 CONT appointed (1075) prelates in various parts of Italy. On being reprimanded 
2 CONT by Pope Gregory VII, Henry convoked (1076) a German council at Worms to 
2 CONT depose the pope. This act resulted in the excommunication of the emperor, 
2 CONT with the consequent release of his subjects from allegiance to him. The 
2 CONT nobles formed a coalition, threatening not to recognize Henry unless he 
2 CONT secured absolution by February 1077. By dressing as a penitent and 
2 CONT standing barefoot in the snow for three days outside the castle of 
2 CONT Canossa, where Pope Gregory was staying, Henry obtained readmission to the 
2 CONT communion of the church. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The German nobles, however, elected Rudolf, duke of Swabia (fl. 1057-80), 
2 CONT to replace Henry. This election caused a civil war. In 1080 the pope 
2 CONT recognized the kingship of Rudolf and again excommunicated Henry, who 
2 CONT declared Pope Gregory deposed and had the Italian archbishop Guibert of 
2 CONT Ravenna (c. 1025-1100) elected in his stead as Pope Clement III. Rudolf 
2 CONT was killed in 1080, and Henry regained control of Germany. He then led his 
2 CONT forces into Italy and captured (1084) Rome, where he was crowned emperor 
2 CONT by Clement III. A Norman army, led by Robert Guiscard, came to the aid of 
2 CONT Pope Gregory, however, and drove Henry from Rome. Henry returned to 
2 CONT Germany and there participated in a long series of civil wars, in which 
2 CONT his sons eventually turned against him. In 1105 he was taken prisoner by 
2 CONT his son Henry, later Emperor Henry V, and forced to abdicate. Escaping in 
2 CONT the next year, Henry IV solicited aid from various sources, including 
2 CONT England, Denmark, and France. He died while gathering an army.

2 CONT jointly with his brother Constantine VIII (960?-1028) after the death of 
2 CONT the usurper John I Tzimisces in 976, but Constantine never took an active 
2 CONT role in government. Basil's greatest achievements were the conquest of 
2 CONT Armenia in the east and the destruction of the Bulgarian Empire, which 
2 CONT threatened Byzantium on the west. He waged war on the Bulgars for nearly 
2 CONT two decades. Defeating (1014) the Bulgarian czar Samuel (flourished 
2 CONT 976-1014), he subjected his people to Byzantine rule and was given the 
2 CONT surname Bulgaroctonos (Slayer of Bulgars). The Byzantine Empire began to

1 NOTE Young was the American religious leader and colonizer of Utah, second 
2 CONT president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Young spent his boyhood in the farm country of Vermont and western New 
2 CONT York and received only two months of formal schooling. He worked as a 
2 CONT carpenter, glazier, and journeyman painter. In 1829 he settled in the town 
2 CONT of Mendon, New York, where he met a brother and disciple of Joseph Smith, 
2 CONT founder and prophet of the Mormons. Smith's brother converted Young, 
2 CONT previously a Methodist, to Mormonism, and on April 14, 1832, he was 
2 CONT baptized and confirmed in the church. Young quickly distinguished himself 
2 CONT as a preacher and evangelist in the area around Mendon; within the year he 
2 CONT was ordained an elder. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Between 1833 and 1836, Young's fame and stature within the Mormon movement 
2 CONT rapidly increased. About 1833 he organized a group of Mormons in the 
2 CONT eastern states and led them to Kirtland, Ohio, where Joseph Smith had 
2 CONT established headquarters. At Kirtland, Young met Smith for the first time. 
2 CONT Impressed by Young's zeal and persuasive powers, Smith sent him into the 
2 CONT surrounding states and Canada on missionary assignments. When, in 1835, 
2 CONT the Mormons created a Quorum, or Council, of Twelve Apostles with powers 
2 CONT second only to those of Smith, Young was named one of the apostles. In 
2 CONT 1836 he was elected president of the Quorum. He was a strong figure in the 
2 CONT movement during the period of persecution, climaxed (1838) by the 
2 CONT migration to Hancock County, Illinois, and the establishment there of 
2 CONT Nauvoo as the new center of Mormonism. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT From 1839 to 1841 Young worked with the Mormon mission in Liverpool, 
2 CONT England, preaching and distributing religious literature; he arranged for 
2 CONT the emigration of about 70,000 converts from Europe to America. He 
2 CONT returned to the U.S. in 1841 and for several years served as a missionary 
2 CONT in the eastern states. After Joseph Smith was shot and killed by a lynch 
2 CONT mob in 1844, Young was elected acting president of the Mormon church and 
2 CONT henceforth was its leader. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Because of sentiment against their group in Illinois, Young and his 
2 CONT colleagues decided to leave Nauvoo. In 1846-47 he organized and supervised 
2 CONT the migration of close to 5000 Mormons across the Great Plains and the 
2 CONT Rocky Mountains into the arid Great Basin. There, in Great Salt Lake 
2 CONT Valley, he founded (July 1847) Great Salt Lake City. On December 5, 1847, 
2 CONT he was formally elected head of the Mormon church. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Under Young's autocratic leadership Salt Lake City and the surrounding 
2 CONT region soon became the Zion, or promised land, that the Mormons had long 
2 CONT sought. His followers build extensive irrigation projects; developed 
2 CONT farms, small businesses, and cooperative stores; and set up a legislature, 
2 CONT public school, and two institutions of higher learning. In 1850 the U.S. 
2 CONT Congress enacted legislation establishing the region, previously known as 
2 CONT the state of Deseret, as the territory of Utah. Young was made territorial 
2 CONT governor. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In August 1852, Young publicly endorsed the doctrine of polygamy, basing 
2 CONT his pronouncement on a revelation said to have been experienced by Joseph 
2 CONT Smith in 1843. His open advocacy of the doctrine disturbed the federal 
2 CONT government and the non-Mormon residents of Utah. Finally, in 1857, 
2 CONT President James Buchanan appointed a new territorial governor. Young 
2 CONT refused to relinquish his post, and when rumors of an armed Mormon 
2 CONT rebellion reached Washington, the president sent federal troops to Utah. 
2 CONT Hostilities were averted, largely as a result of Young's statesmanship, 
2 CONT and the new governor was installed without incident. Nonetheless, as 
2 CONT president of the church, Young continued to play a dominant role in Utah. 
2 CONT In 1871 he was indicted on a polygamy charge but was not convicted. Young 
2 CONT is believed to have married 27 times and was survived by 17 wives and 57 
2 CONT children.

1 NOTE As crown prince, Stephen assisted his father in bringing the war against 
2 CONT the Mongol invaders to a victorious conclusion. In 1260 he was hurt in a 
2 CONT battle against Ottokar II, king of Bohemia (1230-78), in which the 
2 CONT Hungarians were defeated and forced to surrender Styria (now part of 
2 CONT Austria), a region that had been partly under his rule. Stephen thereafter 
2 CONT compelled his father to cede a large part of Hungary to him for his sole 
2 CONT rule. Stephen invaded Bulgaria in 1268 and assumed the title of king of 
2 CONT Bulgaria. On the death of Béla in 1270, he succeeded to the Hungarian 
2 CONT throne. In the following year he repulsed an invasion by Ottokar.

1 NOTE He was the founder of the Anjou dynasty in Hungary.  Charles was crowned 
2 CONT king of Hungary on the death of Andrew III in 1301, but was deposed by 
2 CONT Wenceslas II of Bohemia later that year. He was elected king again by the 
2 CONT Hungarian nobles in 1308 and was formally invested in 1309. Charles levied 
2 CONT direct taxes to support his army, encouraged trade and mercantile 
2 CONT expansion of cities, and increased the territory of Hungary, thus making 
2 CONT Hungary a major power. He was succeeded by his son Louis I.

1 NOTE He was known as the father of the Constitution because of his central role 
2 CONT in the Constitutional Convention. Madison was one of the founders of the 
2 CONT Jeffersonian Republican (Democratic-Republican) party in the 1790s, and he 
2 CONT served as secretary of state (1801-9) under Thomas Jefferson. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 
2 CONT 1771 and in 1776 was elected to the Virginia Convention, called to 
2 CONT consider the relationship of the colonies to Great Britain, at which he 
2 CONT strongly urged independence. From 1777 to 1780 he was a member of the 
2 CONT Governor's Council. In 1780 he was elected to a 3-year term in the 
2 CONT Continental Congress. Although he was the youngest member, Madison quickly 
2 CONT rose to a position of leadership, working unsuccessfully, along with 
2 CONT Alexander Hamilton and others, to strengthen the central government by 
2 CONT giving Congress power to tax and to regulate trade. Madison entered the 
2 CONT Virginia legislature in 1783. An advocate of complete separation of church 
2 CONT and state, he succeeded in persuading the legislature to adopt the Statute 
2 CONT of Virginia for Religious Freedom drafted by Thomas Jefferson. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Constitutional Convention
2 CONT 
2 CONT Working with other proponents of a strong central government, Madison was 
2 CONT largely instrumental in persuading Congress to summon a convention to 
2 CONT revise the Articles of Confederation, or federal constitution. At the 
2 CONT convention, which met in Philadelphia in May 1787, Madison played a 
2 CONT leading role. He drafted the Virginia Plan (introduced by Edmund Randolph) 
2 CONT that became the basis for the structure of the new government. In 
2 CONT accordance with his views, the Constitution provided for a separation of 
2 CONT powers with a system of checks and balances. He was responsible for the 
2 CONT creation of a strong executive with a veto and a judiciary with power to 
2 CONT override state laws. His journal of the proceedings (pub. 1840) 
2 CONT constitutes the sole record of the debates. With Alexander Hamilton and 
2 CONT John Jay he drafted essays (The Federalist Papers) in defense of the 
2 CONT Constitution to rebut those fearful of centralized power. His argument 
2 CONT that liberty would be more secure in a large unit than in small ones 
2 CONT because no group would be able to form an absolute majority has been 
2 CONT confirmed by subsequent experience. In the Virginia Constitutional 
2 CONT Convention he led the successful fight for ratification against the 
2 CONT opposition of Patrick Henry. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Washington, Adams, and Jefferson Administrations
2 CONT 
2 CONT Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1789, Madison sponsored 
2 CONT the first ten amendments to the Constitution (known as the Bill of Rights) 
2 CONT to fulfill a pledge made during the fight over ratification, when it was 
2 CONT charged that the Constitution failed to protect individual rights. In 1791 
2 CONT he broke with Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists, opposing the fiscal 
2 CONT policy of the Washington administration. He joined Thomas Jefferson and 
2 CONT James Monroe in founding the Democratic-Republican party to counteract the 
2 CONT centralizing and aristocratic tendencies of the Federalists then in power.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Madison retired from Congress in 1797. In the following year he drafted 
2 CONT the Virginia Resolutions, condemning as unconstitutional the Alien and 
2 CONT Sedition Acts, by which the Federalists had sought to cripple their 
2 CONT opponents. These resolves, echoing those drafted by Jefferson and adopted 
2 CONT by the Kentucky legislature, asserted the right of the states to nullify 
2 CONT federal laws. In 1799 and 1800 Madison served in the Virginia legislature. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT As secretary of state under Thomas Jefferson, he endeavored without 
2 CONT success to secure European recognition of principles of neutral rights 
2 CONT advanced by the U.S. during the Napoleonic Wars. He also failed to 
2 CONT persuade the British to abandon their interference with U.S. trade and to 
2 CONT cease impressment of American sailors on the high seas. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Madison as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Elected president in 1809 with 122 electoral votes to 47 for the 
2 CONT Federalist candidate Charles Pinckney, Madison approved the repeal of the 
2 CONT embargo by which Jefferson had tried to avoid war through a ban on trade 
2 CONT with the warring European powers. Tensions between the United States and 
2 CONT Britain continued, however, and Madison's conduct of foreign policy was 
2 CONT increasingly criticized both by the Federalists and by members of his own 
2 CONT party. In 1812 Madison asked Congress for a declaration of war against 
2 CONT Great Britain. On the day that war was declared (June 12, 1812), the 
2 CONT British repealed their trade restrictions (Orders in Council). Because 
2 CONT they would not abandon impressment, however, Madison refused to conclude a 
2 CONT truce pending formal peace negotiations. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The War of 1812 was badly managed by Secretary of War John Armstrong 
2 CONT (1758-1843), who failed to take seriously the threat of a British 
2 CONT invasion. When a British invasion force captured Washington in 1814, 
2 CONT Armstrong was replaced by James Monroe. Peace negotiations at Ghent in 
2 CONT Belgium resulted (December 1814) in a treaty that settled none of the 
2 CONT outstanding issues. Andrew Jackson's victory over the British at New 
2 CONT Orleans, although it occurred after the signing of the peace, was widely 
2 CONT regarded as a vindication of American arms in a war many considered a 
2 CONT second American revolution. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In domestic affairs Madison yielded to the rising tide of nationalist 
2 CONT sentiment. Before leaving office he signed a bill for a protective tariff 
2 CONT and agreed to the chartering of a national bank (the Second Bank of the 
2 CONT United States), a measure he had vehemently opposed in 1791. In foreign 
2 CONT affairs his most important action after the war was to negotiate an 
2 CONT agreement (the Rush-Bagot Agreement) for permanent demilitarization of the 
2 CONT frontier between the U.S. and Canada. The Rush-Bagot Agreement was 
2 CONT ratified after Madison left office. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Retirement
2 CONT 
2 CONT Retiring to his estate, Montpelier in Orange County, Virginia, Madison 
2 CONT avoided further participation in party politics but did express his 
2 CONT support for President Andrew Jackson when South Carolina revived the 
2 CONT controversy over nullification of federal laws in 1832. He helped 
2 CONT Jefferson found the University of Virginia and became its rector in 1826. 
2 CONT He was also a member of the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829.

1 NOTE He was the son of an American Revolution general who was later governor of 
2 CONT the state. After graduating from Bowdoin College in 1824, he was admitted 
2 CONT to the bar in 1827 and practiced first at Hillsborough and then at 
2 CONT Concord. He married a member of a distinguished New England family. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In politics Pierce was an active Democrat. He was elected to the state 
2 CONT legislature in 1829 and was chosen Speaker in 1831; he went to Congress in 
2 CONT 1833 and became a U.S. senator in 1837. An opponent of the abolitionists, 
2 CONT he was one of the sponsors of the gag rule against antislavery petitions 
2 CONT in Congress. After resigning from the Senate in 1842, he returned to 
2 CONT Concord, where he became one of the leading members of the Concord 
2 CONT Regency, a group of Democratic political leaders who dominated the party 
2 CONT in New Hampshire. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT His participation as a general in the Mexican War under Winfield Scott, 
2 CONT and his firm support of the North-South components of the Compromise of 
2 CONT 1850, which made him acceptable to the South, enabled him to become the 
2 CONT Democratic candidate for the presidency in 1852. Nominated on the 49th 
2 CONT ballot after a deadlock between his principal rivals, he decisively 
2 CONT defeated General Scott, his Whig opponent in the presidential election. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Pierce as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Shortly before Pierce's inauguration, he lost his 11-year-old son in a 
2 CONT railway accident. The grief caused by this tragedy, and the subsequent 
2 CONT withdrawal of his distraught wife from society, may have contributed to 
2 CONT his lack of success as president. His failure to distribute patronage to 
2 CONT his friends, and the resulting lack of strength in Congress, forced him to 
2 CONT support the Kansas-Nebraska bill in order to please its sponsor, Senator 
2 CONT Stephen A. Douglas. This ill-considered measure, which for the first time 
2 CONT allowed slavery in territories north of 36'30", split both major parties 
2 CONT and greatly aggravated the conflict between the free and the slave states. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Pierce's seeming partiality to the South made him unpopular elsewhere. He 
2 CONT vainly sought to bring peace to Kansas by frequently appointing new 
2 CONT governors and by opposing the local free state movement. His vetoes of 
2 CONT measures for internal improvements further contributed to his troubles in 
2 CONT the North, as did his support for southern efforts to obtain Cuba and 
2 CONT territories in Central America. He was no more successful in foreign 
2 CONT affairs. With the exception of the Gadsden Purchase (1853), by which the 
2 CONT United States gained a strip of land from Mexico, his expansionary 
2 CONT projects miscarried. Publication of the Ostend Manifesto, a declaration by 
2 CONT three American ministers in Europe favoring the annexation of Cuba, 
2 CONT further undermined the administration in the free states. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After failing to obtain renomination in 1856, Pierce withdrew from active 
2 CONT politics. During the American Civil War he was widely denounced for his 
2 CONT outspoken criticism of the Lincoln administration. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Evaluation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Although personally gracious and politically experienced, Pierce did not 
2 CONT measure up to the responsibilities of his high office. Whether because of 
2 CONT his personal misfortunes or his inability to understand the moral issues 
2 CONT inherent in the antislavery struggle, he was unable to assert himself and 
2 CONT provide the leadership needed. This resulted in the destruction of his 
2 CONT hopes for sectional peace.

1 NOTE He was a U.S. general in the Mexican War.  Taken to Kentucky as a child, 
2 CONT he grew up on his father's plantation near Louisville, where he was 
2 CONT educated by local tutors. He was married and had four children; one of 
2 CONT these was the first wife of Jefferson Davis, later Confederate president; 
2 CONT another became a Confederate general.  
2 CONT     
2 CONT Military Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1808 Taylor joined the regular army as an infantry officer. After 
2 CONT distinguishing himself under William Henry Harrison in the War of 1812 and 
2 CONT briefly returning to civilian life, he saw active duty on various frontier 
2 CONT posts in the Northwest and Louisiana, where he established a second home. 
2 CONT He participated in the Black Hawk and Second Seminole wars and in 1838 
2 CONT defeated the Seminole in the Battle of Lake Okeechobee. Although not 
2 CONT decisive, this engagement earned him promotion to the rank of brigadier 
2 CONT general, and he was given overall command of the campaign against the 
2 CONT Seminole in Florida.  
2 CONT   
2 CONT In the early 1840s Taylor was stationed at the southwestern boundaries of 
2 CONT the United States. Sent to Texas shortly before the outbreak of war with 
2 CONT Mexico, he was ordered to advance into the disputed territory between the 
2 CONT Nueces River and the Rio Grande, where he defeated Mexican detachments at 
2 CONT Palo Alto and Roseca de la Palma (May 8-9, 1846). These battles made him 
2 CONT famous and led to the U.S. declaration of war on Mexico. Taylor, now a 
2 CONT major general, subsequently captured Matamoros and Monterrey. Part of his 
2 CONT command was detached to join General Winfield Scott in central Mexico. 
2 CONT Nevertheless, on February 22-23, 1847, Taylor routed a numerically 
2 CONT superior force assembled under Mexican president Antonio López de Santa 
2 CONT Anna at Buena Vista, a feat that thrilled the nation. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Political Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT Taylor, who had never bothered to vote, had little political experience, 
2 CONT but he had quarreled with President James K. Polk and sympathized with the 
2 CONT Whigs, and thus seemed a perfect candidate for the opposition. Although he 
2 CONT declared himself nonpartisan and was a slave owner, which might have made 
2 CONT him unpopular in the North, the Whig party nominated him for the 
2 CONT presidency in 1848. In the ensuing election, he defeated both his 
2 CONT Democratic and Free-Soil opponents. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Taylor administration encountered severe difficulties. To end British 
2 CONT encroachments in Central America, it concluded the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty 
2 CONT (1850) neutralizing any future Atlantic-Pacific canal in that area, an 
2 CONT arrangement that proved unpopular in the U.S. Taylor favored granting 
2 CONT immediate statehood to California and New Mexico, which had been acquired 
2 CONT as a result of the war, but when California prohibited slavery, the South 
2 CONT opposed its admission to the Union. The president, however, refused to 
2 CONT reconsider. Adamantly resisting Henry Clay's compromise proposals, which 
2 CONT sought to balance southern with northern concessions, he declared himself 
2 CONT ready to use force to prevent secession or a threatened seizure of eastern 
2 CONT New Mexico by Texas. His stand completely alienated southern Whigs, and it 
2 CONT contributed to an impasse in the U.S. Congress. In the midst of this 
2 CONT controversy Taylor fell ill and died. His death removed the principal 
2 CONT obstacle to the ultimate passage of the Compromise Measures of 1850. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Taylor was an adequate but by no means brilliant general, who reached the 
2 CONT presidency without preparation at a critical moment. Whether, as has been 
2 CONT suggested, a continuation of his hard-line policy toward the South might 
2 CONT have prevented the American Civil War will never be known.

1 NOTE He tried unsuccessfully to stave off the crisis that led to the American 
2 CONT Civil War. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He was the son of prosperous Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. After graduating 
2 CONT from Dickinson College, he studied law in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where 
2 CONT in 1812 he was admitted to the bar and soon established a flourishing 
2 CONT practice. An able and resourceful advocate, he moved freely in society and 
2 CONT enjoyed the company of women, but after the early death of a fiancée who 
2 CONT had broken with him, he remained a bachelor. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT A Federalist in politics, Buchanan was twice elected to the Pennsylvania 
2 CONT General Assembly (1814, 1815), and in 1821 he entered the U.S. Congress. 
2 CONT Eventually joining the coalition that in 1828 elected Andrew Jackson 
2 CONT president, he became a loyal Democrat, although he generally remained a 
2 CONT moderate on such partisan issues as tariff and bank policies. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT After briefly serving (1832-33) as minister to Russia, Buchanan was 
2 CONT elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. A conciliator rather than an 
2 CONT innovator, he sought to harmonize the various factions of the Democratic 
2 CONT party. In 1845 he became President James K. Polk's secretary of state, a 
2 CONT position in which he again counseled moderation, particularly in 
2 CONT connection with annexations in Mexico and Oregon. In 1852 President 
2 CONT Franklin Pierce appointed him minister to Great Britain, a mission that 
2 CONT kept him away from the country during the Kansas-Nebraska Act controversy. 
2 CONT He incurred criticism by joining the U.S. ambassadors to Spain and France 
2 CONT in signing the Ostend Manifesto (1854), which declared the U.S.'s right to 
2 CONT take Cuba by force should efforts to purchase the slaveholding island 
2 CONT fail. Nevertheless, two years later he won his party's nomination for the 
2 CONT presidency. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Presidency
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1856 Buchanan defeated John C. Frémont, a Republican, and the former 
2 CONT president Millard Fillmore, a Whig, in their bid for the presidency. 
2 CONT Acceptable both to Northern Democrats and Southern moderates, he ran on a 
2 CONT platform of popular sovereignty (the right of settlers in a territory to 
2 CONT decide whether or not to sanction slavery). Within two days of his 
2 CONT inauguration, however, in the Dred Scott decision, of which he had prior 
2 CONT knowledge, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Constitution protected 
2 CONT slavery in all territories. The president's difficulties multiplied with 
2 CONT the depression caused by the Panic of 1857 and with his support for the 
2 CONT admission of Kansas to the Union as a slave state. This aroused opposition 
2 CONT in Buchanan's own party. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Seeking to steer a middle course between the widely divergent philosophies 
2 CONT of the South and North, Buchanan was unable in 1860 to prevent the breakup 
2 CONT of his party or afterward to reunite the factions, one of which supported 
2 CONT Vice-President John C. Breckinridge and the other Sen. Stephen A. Douglas. 
2 CONT In the secession crisis following the victory of Republican Abraham 
2 CONT Lincoln, Buchanan sought to gain time to allow passions to cool. Declaring 
2 CONT that secession was illegal but that he had no power to prevent it, he 
2 CONT attempted to preserve the peace by not provoking secessionists. Stiffening 
2 CONT somewhat after the reorganization of his cabinet, he refused Southern 
2 CONT demands that federal troops be ordered to abandon Fort Sumter in the 
2 CONT harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. His efforts to supply the fort 
2 CONT failed, however, as did his plans for a constitutional convention. He left 
2 CONT office disappointed and discredited. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Well-intentioned and dignified, but a weak executive, Buchanan had the 
2 CONT misfortune of holding office during an extremely difficult period.

1 NOTE He was also as Ferdinand IV he was also king of Naples (1759-1806, 
2 CONT 1815-25), and as Ferdinand III, king of Sicily (1806-15). In 1759 
2 CONT Ferdinand became king of Naples. He ruled for eight years under the 
2 CONT regency of his father's chief minister Bernardo Tanucci (1698-1783). In 
2 CONT 1768 he married the daughter of Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, and 
2 CONT replaced Tanucci with John Francis Edward Acton (1736-1811), an 
2 CONT Englishman. Influenced by his wife and by Acton, Ferdinand allied Naples 
2 CONT with the coalition opposing France in the French Revolution and the 
2 CONT Napoleonic Wars. The French captured Naples in 1799 and there set up the 
2 CONT Parthenopean Republic. Ferdinand found refuge in Palermo, Sicily, until an 
2 CONT army under Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo (1744-1827) recovered Naples later that 
2 CONT year. Ferdinand's return was marked by mass executions of Neapolitans who 
2 CONT had sided with the French. In 1806 he fled once more to Sicily before the 
2 CONT advance of Joseph Bonaparte, who had been made king of Naples by his 
2 CONT brother, Napoleon, and who captured Naples soon thereafter. Ferdinand's 
2 CONT authority was limited to Sicily from 1806 until 1815; his reign was 
2 CONT unpopular, and for a time (1812) his son acted for him as regent. 
2 CONT Ferdinand returned to Naples after Napoleon's overthrow in 1815. The 
2 CONT following year, against the will of most of his subjects, he reconstituted 
2 CONT the kingdom of the Two Sicilies along autocratic lines with the aid of 
2 CONT Austria. He was succeeded by his son, Francis I.

1 NOTE He was a landgrave, or count, of Hesse-Kassel in 1715, when he married the 
2 CONT sister of King Charles XII. In 1718 she succeeded to the throne, and two 
2 CONT years later she abdicated in favor of Frederick. His royal powers were 
2 CONT sharply limited by a new constitution that granted increased legislative 
2 CONT powers to the Riksdag, or Parliament, and vested executive power in a 
2 CONT committee of aristocrats. The aristocracy was, however, divided into two 
2 CONT factions: the Caps, who sought a conciliatory foreign policy, and the 
2 CONT Hats, who wanted to regain territory lost to Russia during the reign of 
2 CONT Charles. In 1738 the Hats gained a political majority, and from 1741 to 
2 CONT 1743 Sweden was at war with Russia. Sweden lost additional territory in 
2 CONT Finland, and Russian influence reached into Sweden. Frederick was 
2 CONT succeeded by Adolph Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp (1710-71), who was 
2 CONT selected by Empress Elizabeth Petrovna of Russia.

1 NOTE He was an American diplomat and editor and educated at Harvard University. 
2 CONT He was admitted to the bar in 1829. Adams served for five years in the 
2 CONT Massachusetts legislature as a member of the Whig party. In 1858 and again 
2 CONT in 1860, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from 
2 CONT Massachusetts as a member of the Republican party. In 1861 he was 
2 CONT appointed minister to Great Britain by Abraham Lincoln. His skillful 
2 CONT handling of this position during the American Civil War (1861-65), when 
2 CONT the British government rendered aid to the Confederacy, is an outstanding 
2 CONT chapter in the history of American diplomacy. In the so-called Trent 
2 CONT affair, the first major crisis in Anglo-American relations during the war, 
2 CONT his calm and tact were instrumental in averting hostilities between the 
2 CONT two nations. Although he failed to prevent the sailing of the Alabama, a 
2 CONT raider built in Great Britain for the Confederacy, his efforts with the 
2 CONT British government later resulted in the detention of other Confederate 
2 CONT vessels. He resigned as minister to Great Britain in 1868. In 1871 he 
2 CONT became a member of the Alabama claims tribunal. He edited the Life and 
2 CONT Works of John Adams (10 vol., 1850-56), the Memoirs of John Quincy Adams 
2 CONT (12 vol., 1874-77), and the Familiar Letters of John Adams and His Wife, 
2 CONT Abigail (2 vol., 1876).

1 NOTE Adams, John (1735-1826), second president (1797-1801) and first 
2 CONT vice-president (1789-97) of the United States, and leader in the movement 
2 CONT for independence. His presidency was marked by rivalry with 
2 CONT fellow-Federalist Alexander Hamilton, controversy over government measures 
2 CONT taken to curb political opposition, and a crisis in U.S. relations with 
2 CONT France. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Adams was born on October 30, 1735, in Braintree (now Quincy), 
2 CONT Massachusetts, a town in which Adamses had lived since 1638. His father 
2 CONT had married into a wealthy Boston family, the Boylstons, and was thus able 
2 CONT to send his son to Harvard College, from which young Adams graduated in 
2 CONT 1755. He then selected law and soon found that in the courtroom his 
2 CONT acquired erudition and intellectual precision overcame his natural 
2 CONT timidity, and he became a powerful speaker and an adroit advocate. At the 
2 CONT age of 29 Adams married Abigail Smith, a woman who was clearly his 
2 CONT intellectual and psychological equal. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Coming of the Revolution
2 CONT 
2 CONT The controversy that preceded the American Revolution catapulted Adams 
2 CONT into a position of political leadership. His Braintree Instructions (1765) 
2 CONT was a powerful denunciation of the Stamp Act, and his oddly titled 
2 CONT Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law (1765) was a prescient analysis 
2 CONT of the emotional and ideological demands facing the colonists. Chosen as a 
2 CONT lawyer for several British soldiers charged with the death of five 
2 CONT colonists in the Boston Massacre (1770), Adams successfully defended his 
2 CONT clients by justifying their use of force out of fear for their lives. In 
2 CONT his essays Novanglus (1774-75), he defended colonial resistance and argued 
2 CONT that the British Empire was in reality a league of nearly autonomous 
2 CONT entities; thus, he anticipated 19th-century self-government of British 
2 CONT overseas possessions. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In the First and Second Continental Congresses, Adams emerged as a 
2 CONT powerful exponent of the historic rights of the English and the natural 
2 CONT rights of humankind. Along with his cousin Samuel Adams, he initiated 
2 CONT (1775) the effort to secure the appointment of George Washington as 
2 CONT commander of the new Continental army. Adams served on the committee to 
2 CONT draft the Declaration of Independence, but when Thomas Jefferson later 
2 CONT claimed that Adams had given him a free hand in composing it, Adams 
2 CONT responded indignantly that the document was a theatrical show in which 
2 CONT Jefferson ran away with the stage effect  and all the glory of it. Thus 
2 CONT began a rivalry that continued for more than a decade. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT More clearly perhaps than any other leading patriot of his day, Adams 
2 CONT expressed the fear that he and his fellow revolutionaries might fail in 
2 CONT summoning forth the virtue and objectivity required to avoid loss of nerve 
2 CONT and internal factionalism. His Thoughts on Government (1776), in which he 
2 CONT elaborated on these warnings, became a handbook on the writing of early 
2 CONT state constitutions and particularly influenced the preparation of those 
2 CONT documents in Virginia, North Carolina, and Massachusetts. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Diplomatic Service and Vice-Presidency
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1778 Congress sent Adams and John Jay to join Benjamin Franklin as 
2 CONT diplomatic representatives in Europe. Franklin remained the American envoy 
2 CONT to France; Adams went to the Dutch Republic and had the responsibility for 
2 CONT opening negotiations with Britain; Jay traveled to Spain. In 1782 and 
2 CONT 1783, the three men together negotiated the Treaty of Paris, ending the 
2 CONT 8-year war with Great Britain. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1785 Adams was appointed diplomatic envoy to Great Britain, a position 
2 CONT he held until 1788. His duties in England caused him to miss the 
2 CONT Constitutional Convention and the ratifying debates. He had played a 
2 CONT crucial role earlier, however, in drafting the Massachusetts Constitution 
2 CONT of 1780. While in London he wrote the three-volume Defence of the 
2 CONT Constitutions of Government of the United States of America. This work 
2 CONT rebutted a French critic of American politics and reiterated Adams's 
2 CONT belief that only formal restraints on the exercise of power and on the 
2 CONT impulses of the populace could militate against human evil and societal 
2 CONT weaknesses. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Because he ran second to Washington in electoral-college balloting in both 
2 CONT 1788 and 1792, Adams became the nation's first vice-president. In that 
2 CONT capacity, he limited himself to presiding over the Senate. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Presidency
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1796 Adams was chosen to succeed Washington as president, winning over 
2 CONT Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Pinckney. The threat of war with France, along 
2 CONT with the resulting passionate debate over foreign policy and the limits of 
2 CONT dissent, dominated the politics of his administration. The war scare was 
2 CONT sparked by American indignation over French attempts to extort money from 
2 CONT U.S. representatives in the so-called XYZ affair. A conflict arose over 
2 CONT the measures to be taken in preparation for possible hostilities. Adams 
2 CONT favored strengthening the navy and building coastal fortifications, but an 
2 CONT opposing group led by former secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton 
2 CONT persuaded Congress to create a large standing army, with Hamilton himself 
2 CONT as inspector general. Because the possibility of a French invasion of the 
2 CONT U.S. was remote, the clear implication of this policy was the creation of 
2 CONT an army the size and strength of which could intimidate opposition 
2 CONT Republican voters. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Alien and Sedition Acts
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Hamilton Federalists added substance to those fears by pushing through 
2 CONT Congress laws restricting the rights and privileges of aliens (presumed to 
2 CONT be potential Republican voters or, worse yet, French radicals) and 
2 CONT punishing as sedition the printing of false attacks on the dignity or 
2 CONT integrity of high government officials. Adams found enough merit in these 
2 CONT bills to sign them, and he acquiesced in 14 prosecutions under the 
2 CONT Sedition Act. The Alien Acts, however, he refused to enforce. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT One of Adams's most fateful decisions was to retain the cabinet he had 
2 CONT inherited from Washington, several members of which were personally loyal 
2 CONT to Hamilton. Together with Hamilton's supporters in Congress, they 
2 CONT engineered the creation of the new army, which Hamilton in actuality 
2 CONT controlled. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Agreement with France
2 CONT 
2 CONT Adams did, however, demonstrate the power of the presidency to confront 
2 CONT challenges to executive leadership. In February 1799, he appointed new 
2 CONT peace commissioners to go to France and reopen negotiations. Adams's 
2 CONT timing and judgment were acute; the French foreign minister Charles 
2 CONT Maurice de Talleyrand had sent a distinct diplomatic signal that he wanted 
2 CONT peace with the U.S. Thus, when the secretary of state Timothy Pickering, a 
2 CONT Hamilton follower, tried to sabotage the peace mission, Adams fired him; 
2 CONT the two nations quickly came to terms. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The peace initiative enabled Adams to dismantle the new army, much to 
2 CONT Hamilton's embarrassment. Adams's foreign policy, however, split the 
2 CONT Federalist party on the eve of the 1800 election and contributed 
2 CONT significantly to the election of Thomas Jefferson as well as to Republican 
2 CONT victories in both houses of Congress. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Retirement
2 CONT 
2 CONT Adams lived for a quarter century after he left the presidency, during 
2 CONT which time he wrote extensively. His guiding principles were embodied in a 
2 CONT Whig philosophy to which he clung stubbornly. Ill-suited to adapt to the 
2 CONT transition to 19th-century romantic culture, he was nevertheless a 
2 CONT magnificent exponent of the pessimistic view of human society. He died in 
2 CONT Quincy, Massachusetts, on July 4, 1826.

1 NOTE Adams, John Quincy (1767-1848), sixth president of the United States 
2 CONT (1825-29), who combined brilliant statesmanship with skillful diplomacy. 
2 CONT As secretary of state (1817-25) he ranks among the ablest holders of the 
2 CONT office, and he played a major role in formulating American foreign policy. 
2 CONT As an eight-term member of the House of Representatives (1831-48) he was a 
2 CONT leading defender of freedom of speech and a spokesman for the antislavery 
2 CONT cause. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT Adams was born in Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts, on July 11, 1767, 
2 CONT the eldest son of John and Abigail Adams. Remarkably precocious, at the 
2 CONT age of 12 he accompanied his father to Europe. He served as French 
2 CONT translator to Francis Dana (1743-1811), U.S. minister to Russia, in 
2 CONT 1781-83 and as his father's secretary in 1783, during the peace 
2 CONT negotiations that ended the American Revolution. He graduated from Harvard 
2 CONT College and opened a law office in Boston. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Adams's Publicole essays, attacking the views Thomas Paine expressed in 
2 CONT the Rights of Man, won him early political recognition. In 1793 President 
2 CONT George Washington named him minister to Holland and then sent him to 
2 CONT London to aid John Jay in negotiations with the British (Jay's Treaty). In 
2 CONT London he met Louisa Catherine Johnson (1775-1852), whom he married in 
2 CONT 1797; it was a happy union, marked by deep affection. That same year he 
2 CONT became minister to Prussia, with which he concluded a pact incorporating 
2 CONT the neutral rights provisions of Jay's Treaty. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1801 Adams was elected to the Massachusetts Senate and two years later 
2 CONT to the U.S. Senate. Although a Federalist, he followed an independent 
2 CONT course. Adams's support of the Louisiana Purchase and his endorsement of 
2 CONT President Thomas Jefferson's policy of commercial warfare led to a break 
2 CONT with his party and his resignation in 1808. The following year President 
2 CONT James Madison appointed him minister to Russia, where he did much to 
2 CONT encourage Czar Alexander's friendly feelings toward the U.S. As one of the 
2 CONT delegates sent to Ghent to negotiate an end to the War of 1812, Adams 
2 CONT found the British commissioners so intransigent that he had to approve a 
2 CONT peace treaty (1814) that fell short of U.S. expectations. In 1815 he was 
2 CONT appointed minister to Great Britain, where he did much to ease tensions 
2 CONT resulting from the war. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Secretary of State
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1817 President James Monroe chose Adams as his secretary of state, 
2 CONT inaugurating a long and harmonious association, for the two men agreed on 
2 CONT basic foreign policy aims. Both were expansionists, and both wanted the 
2 CONT U.S. to follow a course distinct from that of the European powers. Monroe 
2 CONT closely controlled foreign policy but relied heavily on the advice of 
2 CONT Adams, who was an adroit negotiator. Adams's state papers are among the 
2 CONT most brilliant ever penned by a secretary of state. With Monroe's support, 
2 CONT he forced Spain to cede Florida and to make a favorable settlement of the 
2 CONT Louisiana boundary in the Transcontinental Treaty drafted in 1819. His 
2 CONT protracted negotiations with the French minister on outstanding issues 
2 CONT between the two countries were less successful. The treaty concluded in 
2 CONT 1822 only provided for a gradual reduction of France's discriminatory 
2 CONT tariff, leaving other questions unsettled. His efforts to persuade Great 
2 CONT Britain to open its West Indian trade to American ships were unsuccessful. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Adams did not share Monroe's apprehension that the European powers might 
2 CONT intervene to suppress the South American revolutions and restore Spain's 
2 CONT authority in its colonies. He was concerned, however, about Russian 
2 CONT expansion on the west coast and thus welcomed Monroe's decision to 
2 CONT formulate in his annual message of December 1823 a declaration (later 
2 CONT known as the Monroe Doctrine) expressing American opposition to European 
2 CONT intervention in the Americas. At Adams's suggestion, Monroe added a 
2 CONT statement declaring that the U.S. regarded the western hemisphere as 
2 CONT closed to further European colonization. As a result, Adams obtained a 
2 CONT pledge from Russia to remain north of latitude 54'40". The British, 
2 CONT however, refused to vacate the Columbia River area. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT President
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1824 Adams was involved in a bitter presidential contest in which none 
2 CONT of the four candidates obtained a majority in the electoral college. 
2 CONT Adams, with 84 votes (all from New England), ran behind Andrew Jackson 
2 CONT (99) but ahead of William H. Crawford (41) and Henry Clay (37). Victory 
2 CONT went to Adams in the House of Representatives, when Clay supported him. 
2 CONT Adams's choice of Clay as secretary of state led to a charge (probably 
2 CONT unfounded) of a corrupt bargain in effect, that Clay had purchased the 
2 CONT office with his votes. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Adams's presidency was marred by the incessant hostility of the combined 
2 CONT Jackson and Crawford supporters in Congress, which prevented Adams from 
2 CONT executing his envisaged nationalist program. His proposals for the 
2 CONT creation of a department of the interior were rebuffed. Only after 
2 CONT acrimonious debate did he obtain the appointment of delegates to a 
2 CONT congress of the American nations in Panama (1826). Committed to the idea 
2 CONT of a protective tariff, Adams in 1828 was maneuvered into signing the 
2 CONT grossly unfair Tariff of Abominations, thereby alienating the South, as 
2 CONT his enemies hoped he would. He steadfastly refused to use the federal 
2 CONT patronage to strengthen his party support, allowing his postmaster general 
2 CONT to appoint Jackson backers. In the election of 1828, pilloried as an 
2 CONT aristocrat favoring special interests, Adams was overwhelmingly defeated 
2 CONT by Jackson (178 to 83 electoral votes).

2 CONT Two years after the end of his presidency, Adams returned to politics, 
2 CONT entering the House of Representatives. Now nominally a Whig, he still 
2 CONT followed an independent course. For ten years he chaired the Committee on 
2 CONT Manufacturers, which drafted tariff bills. He lauded Jackson's firm 
2 CONT resistance to southern attempts to nullify the tariff of 1832, but 
2 CONT condemned the compromise tariff of 1833 (not drafted by his committee) as 
2 CONT being too great a concession to the nullificationists. After 1835 he was 
2 CONT identified with the antislavery forces, although not with the 
2 CONT abolitionists. Every year from 1836 to 1844 he led the fight to lift the 
2 CONT gag rule that had ordered the tabling of all resolutions concerning 
2 CONT slavery. He triumphed in 1844, when it was rescinded. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT A vigorous speaker, Adams earned the sobriquet Old Man Eloquent. 
2 CONT Throughout his lifetime he kept a voluminous diary, later edited by his 
2 CONT son, Charles Francis Adams. On February 21, 1848, he suffered a stroke on 
2 CONT the floor of the House, and he died two days later without regaining 
2 CONT consciousness.

1 NOTE His claim to fame rests not on his administration for he died of pneumonia 
2 CONT one month after his inauguration but on the strange campaign by which in 
2 CONT 1840 he attained the high office. A minor military hero, he rode to glory 
2 CONT by saying nothing (General Mum, his critics called him), while his party, 
2 CONT the Whigs, capitalized on a propaganda blunder by their Democratic 
2 CONT opponents to proclaim Harrison a simple man used to living in a log cabin. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Harrison was born to one of the wealthiest, most prestigious, and most 
2 CONT influential families in Virginia, on a great plantation in Berkeley 
2 CONT County. From the early 17th century on, the Harrisons had accumulated vast 
2 CONT landholdings, occupied the highest political and judicial positions, and 
2 CONT intermarried with the leading families of Virginia. William Henry's 
2 CONT youthful military career and his appointment, when he was not yet 30 years 
2 CONT old, to the prominent post of governor of Indiana Territory were due more 
2 CONT to the influence of his father, Benjamin Harrison, who was several times 
2 CONT governor of Virginia, than to any military or administrative talent that 
2 CONT he himself had demonstrated. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Military Hero
2 CONT 
2 CONT Harrison had a modest career that was lighted up on two occasions by 
2 CONT significant military successes. After devoting his tenure as territorial 
2 CONT governor to negotiating the western Indian tribes out of millions of 
2 CONT acres, he commanded a force of militia and regulars that put down a 
2 CONT Shawnee uprising at Tippecanoe, Indiana, in 1811. Although Harrison's own 
2 CONT policies as governor had helped provoke the rebellion, his victory won him 
2 CONT a reputation that helped vault him to the presidency a generation later. 
2 CONT In the year following the outbreak of the War of 1812, Harrison won 
2 CONT another important battle, fought near the Thames River in the province of 
2 CONT Ontario, Canada, that ensured continued American control of the western 
2 CONT territory. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although Harrison's career was moderately successful he was several times 
2 CONT elected to the Ohio Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives his life 
2 CONT at this time was beset by financial difficulties. For a short period in 
2 CONT 1828 he served as minister to Colombia, but President John Quincy Adams, 
2 CONT who appointed him to the diplomatic post because of his connections, had 
2 CONT low regard for Harrison's ability, and this poor opinion was shared by 
2 CONT political figures in Washington, D.C. The nation, however, remembered his 
2 CONT military exploits, and in the mid-1830s and again in 1840 Whig party 
2 CONT managers decided to exploit them. As one of a number of Whig candidates in 
2 CONT 1836, Harrison was an also-ran. In 1840, however, benefiting from the 
2 CONT artful campaign tactics of his party, Harrison succeeded. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The 1840 Campaign
2 CONT 
2 CONT Seeking victory at almost any price, the Whig party in 1840 passed over 
2 CONT Henry Clay, its true leader, choosing the aging general instead. To appeal 
2 CONT to the South, they chose a states' rights southern Democrat, John Tyler, 
2 CONT as his running mate. Convinced that they could win by blaming the severe 
2 CONT economic depression on the policies of President Martin Van Buren, they 
2 CONT also derided "Van" for his alleged aristocratic manners, commanded 
2 CONT Harrison to be silent on the issues, refused to present a party platform, 
2 CONT and waged a rousing campaign, using the slogan "Tippecanoe and Tyler too." 
2 CONT Taking advantage of a sneering Democratic reference to Harrison as a man 
2 CONT content to sit in his log cabin sipping hard cider, the Whigs' propaganda 
2 CONT transformed the Virginia aristocrat into a poor farmer. Seldom has 
2 CONT demogoguery paid off so well. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Perhaps Harrison's most significant act in his abbreviated term was his 
2 CONT appointment of Daniel Webster as secretary of state.

1 NOTE He directed a reformulation of the Monroe Doctrine that was to end 
2 CONT American isolationism and set the stage for future territorial and trade 
2 CONT expansion. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The grandson of President William Henry Harrison, he grew up on his 
2 CONT father's farm on the banks of the Ohio River. After graduating from Miami 
2 CONT University in Oxford, Ohio, he took a law clerkship in Indianapolis.  He 
2 CONT soon became involved in the newly formed Republican party, serving as 
2 CONT secretary to the state convention and as a popular campaign speaker. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During the American Civil War, Harrison helped raise Indiana's 70th 
2 CONT Infantry and became its commander. He was promoted to brigadier general 
2 CONT after serving with distinction in the Atlanta campaign. When peace came, 
2 CONT he returned to his law practice in Indianapolis and resumed activities in 
2 CONT the Republican party. Defeated in a bid for the governorship of Indiana in 
2 CONT 1876, he served in the U.S. Senate from 1881 to 1887. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Harrison as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1888 party factionalism prevented the nomination of the leading 
2 CONT presidential contender, James G. Blaine, and Harrison, a dark horse, won 
2 CONT the Republican party's nomination for the presidency. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Harrison defeated the incumbent, Grover Cleveland, on a platform of 
2 CONT protectionism. As president, however, Harrison was never a charismatic 
2 CONT leader, nor was he able to negotiate alliances with Congress to obtain 
2 CONT support for his policies. His isolation from Congress promoted further 
2 CONT charges of coldness (cold as ice had been a description of his 
2 CONT gubernatorial candidacy) and lost him the support of many party members. 
2 CONT He continued the civil service reforms of his predecessors, but at a 
2 CONT moderate pace, alienating both those Republicans who were looking for 
2 CONT spoils and those urging more rapid reform. Moreover, although he had 
2 CONT campaigned on a platform of liberalizing veterans' pensions, he was forced 
2 CONT to remove his own commissioner of pensions for lavishly and scandalously 
2 CONT distributing awards. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Harrison experienced difficulty in maintaining a stable national economy. 
2 CONT The Bland-Allison Act of 1878 required the treasury to buy $2 million of 
2 CONT silver for coinage each month. As the market value of silver fell, the 
2 CONT president sought to limit coinage. Advocates of free coinage forced a 
2 CONT compromise bill, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act (1890), which required 
2 CONT the government to buy more silver but limited coinage. The increased 
2 CONT purchase drained gold from the reserves, and Harrison twice had to avert 
2 CONT panic by releasing more currency. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Harrison had campaigned on a platform of increasing protectionist tariffs. 
2 CONT Although the public supported increased tariffs at the time of the 
2 CONT election, the effect of the McKinley Act (1890) was to contribute to 
2 CONT inflationary prices for necessities, and protectionist tariffs ultimately 
2 CONT became unpopular. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Harrison admitted several new states to the Union during his term. He 
2 CONT increased the size of the merchant marine to facilitate expanded trade and 
2 CONT of the navy to protect commercial interests abroad. The first Pan-American 
2 CONT Conference, held during his administration, created new commercial and 
2 CONT diplomatic ties between the U.S. and independent republics in Latin 
2 CONT America. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Later Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT A loyal Republican, Harrison continued to serve as his party's spokesman 
2 CONT after his defeat by Grover Cleveland in 1892. He resumed his law practice, 
2 CONT taking on the international dispute between Venezuela and England over 
2 CONT boundaries and earning respect for his legal expertise. He also wrote 
2 CONT several addresses and articles on governmental affairs that were well 
2 CONT received and widely read. He died a respected elder statesman.

1 NOTE He was educated privately and at the École Militaire. Before his accession 
2 CONT to the throne he bore the title count of Flanders. His democratic manner 
2 CONT made him the most popular member of the reigning house. He traveled widely 
2 CONT and was a student of politics and economics. In 1898 and again in 1919 he 
2 CONT visited the U.S. In 1900 he made an extended tour of the Belgian Congo and 
2 CONT on his return to Belgium urged the need of railroad development and of 
2 CONT reform in the treatment of the Congolese; when he became king, he ordered 
2 CONT many improvements in the administration of this colony. On the death of 
2 CONT Leopold II in 1909, Albert acceded to the throne. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT While on a visit to Berlin in 1913, Albert was informed of Germany's plans 
2 CONT for war by Emperor William II. He immediately warned France and on July 
2 CONT 31, 1914, sent a personal letter to the German emperor informing him that 
2 CONT Belgium would remain neutral. When the letter was ignored and German 
2 CONT troops poured into Belgium, Albert assumed active command of his army and 
2 CONT directed a successful delaying action against invasion. He remained with 
2 CONT his troops throughout the war. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After World War I he played an active role in the reconstruction of his 
2 CONT country and in 1919 made a plea to the Allies for the abolition of the 
2 CONT Treaty of London, which made Belgium neutral ground and thus vulnerable to 
2 CONT invasion. As a result, the abolition of the treaty was incorporated into 
2 CONT the Treaty of Versailles. Albert supported general industrial expansion 
2 CONT and the development of a strong merchant fleet as the best methods of 
2 CONT national recovery. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Leopold III.

1 NOTE The first Swedish ruler of the Palatinate dynasty, he became king when his 
2 CONT cousin, Queen Christina, abdicated in his favor. Charles succeeded to the 
2 CONT throne of an almost bankrupt kingdom; nevertheless, he hoped to increase 
2 CONT the territory of the country at the expense of nations weakened by the 
2 CONT Thirty Years' War. In 1655, on the pretext of preventing his cousin, King 
2 CONT John II Casimir of Poland, from seizing the Swedish crown, Charles invaded 
2 CONT Poland. He formed an alliance with Frederick William, elector of 
2 CONT Brandenburg, and was victorious at Warsaw. Soon thereafter Russia, 
2 CONT Denmark, and the Holy Roman Empire all declared war on Sweden, and 
2 CONT Frederick William switched sides when the Poles agreed to recognize his 
2 CONT territorial claims. Charles retired from Poland, but in 1658, leading his 
2 CONT army across the frozen sea, he forced the Danes to capitulate. By the 
2 CONT Treaty of Roskilde, King Frederick II of Denmark ceded all his lands in 
2 CONT southern Sweden to Charles. Hoping for a total conquest of Denmark, 
2 CONT Charles attacked again later in the year but was rebuffed by a stout 
2 CONT Danish defense of Copenhagen. Charles died soon thereafter, and he was 
2 CONT succeeded by his son Charles XI.

1 NOTE Soon after Charles succeeded to the throne, Sweden, with extensive 
2 CONT possessions on the Baltic, was threatened by a coalition of Frederick IV, 
2 CONT king of Denmark, Augustus II, king of Poland (1670-1733), and Peter I, 
2 CONT czar of Russia, which resulted in the Great Northern War (1700-21). In 
2 CONT 1700, Charles invaded Denmark and quickly forced Frederick to sign the 
2 CONT Peace of Travendal (now Traventhal). Charles hastened to the Baltic and 
2 CONT rapidly brought his army of 8000 men to the Swedish stronghold, Narva, 
2 CONT Estonia, which was beleaguered by 40,000 Russians. The disciplined Swedish 
2 CONT troops, although wearied by forced marches, totally routed the Russians in 
2 CONT November 1700. Charles then turned to conquer Poland, which was overrun by 
2 CONT the Swedish troops. Augustus was driven into Saxony, and Charles obtained 
2 CONT the election of his ally Stanislas I Leszczyñski as king of Poland in 
2 CONT 1705. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Charles then marched into Saxony, and Augustus, by the Treaty of 
2 CONT Altranstädt of 1706, was forced to recognize Stanislas. Charles was now at 
2 CONT the height of his power; with a disciplined army holding Germany in awe, 
2 CONT he spurned peace overtures from Peter. Determined to humble Russia, he 
2 CONT began an invasion of the country in September 1707. He penetrated into the 
2 CONT interior of Russia, his army harassed along the way, suffered through two 
2 CONT severe winters and turned south. On July 8, 1709, while besieging Poltava, 
2 CONT Ukraine, he was attacked by the Russian army. Within three days, all his 
2 CONT previous military success was undone in one disastrous engagement. Charles 
2 CONT barely escaped into Turkish territory. He induced Sultan Ahmed III 
2 CONT (1673-1736) to attack Russia. In 1711 Peter was able to escape from a 
2 CONT precarious position on the Prut River. The Swedish monarch spent the next 
2 CONT three years in intrigues to induce Turkey to attack Russia again. When he 
2 CONT found that his plots were of no avail, he defied the Turkish power and was 
2 CONT imprisoned. He escaped in 1714 and reached Stralsund, a Swedish possession 
2 CONT in Pomerania. The city was besieged by a combined force of Danes, 
2 CONT Prussians, and Saxons for a year before it surrendered. Charles again 
2 CONT escaped, reached Sweden, and raised another army. He began an invasion of 
2 CONT Norway in 1717. During this struggle he was killed at Frederikshald on 
2 CONT November 30, 1718. He was succeeded on the throne by his sister Ulrika 
2 CONT Eleonora, who began the process of negotiating peace to end the war that 
2 CONT had cost Sweden its rank as a great power in the Baltic region.

1 NOTE During his minority the government was entrusted to a regency, and 
2 CONT although the kingdom was kept free from foreign wars, it was misgoverned. 
2 CONT The education of the young king was so neglected that he was nearly 
2 CONT illiterate. In 1672 he assumed the reins of government. Under terms of an 
2 CONT agreement made by the regency, Charles in 1674 entered the Dutch Wars as 
2 CONT an ally of Louis XIV, king of France. The Swedish army and navy were 
2 CONT unprepared for war, and Sweden lost territory, although much of it was 
2 CONT restored by the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1679. Charles, angered 
2 CONT by the military failure, and supported by the burghers and peasants, 
2 CONT instituted reforms that strengthened the armed forces and considerably 
2 CONT reduced the power of the former regents and nobles. In 1682 the Riksdag, 
2 CONT the Swedish legislature, granted the king absolute authority. By a 
2 CONT judicious administration of revenues, he wiped out the public debt, 
2 CONT reorganized the army and navy, and by 1693 was able to dispense with 
2 CONT extraordinary subsidies. Although he had absolute power, he never imposed 
2 CONT a tax without consent; and he published an annual account of revenues and 
2 CONT expenditures. He was succeeded by his son Charles XII.

1 NOTE (German Franz Josef) He was the last important ruler of the Habsburg 
2 CONT dynasty; his policies played a major role in the events that led to World 
2 CONT War I. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Francis Charles (his father) having renounced his right to the throne, 
2 CONT Francis Joseph became emperor when Ferdinand abdicated during the 
2 CONT revolution of 1848. With Russian help, he and his prime minister, Felix, 
2 CONT prince zu Schwarzenberg (1800-52), restored order in the empire and 
2 CONT reestablished Austrian dominance in the German confederation (1849-50).  
2 CONT Francis Joseph's failure to support Russia in the Crimean War (1854-56) 
2 CONT permanently damaged Austro-Russian relations, and in the decade that 
2 CONT followed, Austria lost most of its Italian possessions, as well as its 
2 CONT position of leadership in Germany. Weakened by these reverses, Francis 
2 CONT Joseph was forced to agree to Hungarian demands for autonomy in 1867, when 
2 CONT he and Elizabeth were formally crowned in Budapest as king and queen of 
2 CONT Hungary. He also planned to grant some form of self-government to the 
2 CONT Austrian Slavs but backed down because of opposition from the German and 
2 CONT Hungarian elite that controlled the new monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The 
2 CONT resulting dissatisfaction among Francis Joseph's Czechoslovakian and 
2 CONT Serbian subjects further weakened the Habsburg realms and caused increased 
2 CONT friction with Russia, which championed the cause of Europe's Slavic 
2 CONT peoples. Beginning in the 1870s, Austria-Hungary gradually became 
2 CONT subservient to its powerful neighbor and ally, the Prussian-dominated 
2 CONT German Empire. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Francis Joseph's later years were marked by a series of tragedies in his 
2 CONT family. In 1889 his only son and heir to the throne, Archduke Rudolf, 
2 CONT committed suicide; in 1898 his wife, the empress Elizabeth, was 
2 CONT assassinated by an Italian anarchist; and in 1914 his nephew, Francis 
2 CONT Ferdinand, who had replaced Rudolf as heir to the throne, was assassinated 
2 CONT by a Serbian nationalist. The murder of Francis Ferdinand precipitated the 
2 CONT crisis between Austria-Hungary and Germany on the one hand, and Serbia and 
2 CONT Russia on the other, that led to World War I. Francis Joseph did not live 
2 CONT to see Austria's defeat in the war and the extinction of the Habsburg 
2 CONT monarchy.

1 NOTE Lee, Henry (1756-1818), American military leader and politician, a 
2 CONT brilliant cavalry commander during the American Revolution. He was a 
2 CONT cousin of Arthur and Francis Lee, born near Dumfries, Virginia, and 
2 CONT educated at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Called 
2 CONT Lighthorse Harry Lee, he earned his nickname for his frequent successes as 
2 CONT an outpost leader. In 1775 Lee joined the Virginia cavalry as a captain, 
2 CONT and two years later he was transferred to the Continental army unit of 
2 CONT General George Washington in Pennsylvania. He was promoted to major for 
2 CONT valor in battle in January 1778 and was placed in command of two troops of 
2 CONT horse, a force later increased by another troop of horse and one of 
2 CONT infantry. Lee showed a masterly command of guerrilla tactics in his use of 
2 CONT this force, harassing the British both on the march and in camp. His 
2 CONT capture of Paulus Hook (now Jersey City), New Jersey, which he took in a 
2 CONT surprise raid on August 19, 1779, is regarded as one of the most brilliant 
2 CONT exploits of the war. Lee was rewarded for this coup by promotion to the 
2 CONT rank of lieutenant colonel, and Congress awarded him a gold medal. In 
2 CONT 1780-81 he operated in the Carolinas in support of General Nathanael 
2 CONT Greene and his Army of the South in the Carolinas, covering, by his 
2 CONT ceaseless stinging forays against the British, Greene's retreat across 
2 CONT North Carolina to Virginia. Lee resigned his commission because of ill 
2 CONT health in 1781. From 1785 to 1788, as a member of the Continental 
2 CONT Congress, he supported the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. He was 
2 CONT governor of Virginia from 1791 to 1794 and served in the U.S. House of 
2 CONT Representatives from 1799 to 1801. It was Lee who, in 1799, before both 
2 CONT houses of Congress, delivered the funeral oration on George Washington, 
2 CONT originating the now familiar phrase: First in war, first in peace, first 
2 CONT in the hearts of his countrymen. He wrote Memoirs of the War in the 
2 CONT Southern Department (1812).

1 NOTE Lee, Robert E(dward) (1807-70), brilliant Confederate general, whose 
2 CONT military genius was probably the greatest single factor in keeping the 
2 CONT Confederacy alive through the four years of the American Civil War. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Lee was born on January 19, 1807, in Stratford, Virginia, the son of 
2 CONT Lighthorse Harry Lee, and was educated at the U.S. Military Academy. He 
2 CONT graduated second in his class in 1829, receiving a commission as second 
2 CONT lieutenant in the engineers. He became first lieutenant in 1836, and 
2 CONT captain in 1838. He distinguished himself in the battles of the Mexican 
2 CONT War and was wounded in the storming of Chapultepec in 1847; for his 
2 CONT meritorious service he received his third brevet promotion in rank. He 
2 CONT became superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy and later was appointed 
2 CONT colonel of cavalry. He was in command of the Department of Texas in 1860, 
2 CONT and, early the following year, was summoned to Washington, D.C., when war 
2 CONT between the states seemed imminent. President Abraham Lincoln offered him 
2 CONT the field command of the Union forces, but Lee declined. On April 20, 
2 CONT three days after Virginia seceded from the Union, he submitted his 
2 CONT resignation from the U.S. Army. On April 23 he became commander in chief 
2 CONT of the military and naval forces of Virginia. For a year he was military 
2 CONT adviser to Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of 
2 CONT America, and was then placed in command of the army in northern Virginia. 
2 CONT In February 1865 Lee was made commander in chief of all Confederate 
2 CONT armies; two months later the war was virtually ended by his surrender to 
2 CONT General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House. His great battles 
2 CONT included those of Antietam, Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, and 
2 CONT Gettysburg. see Civil War, American; see also separate articles on the 
2 CONT battles mentioned. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The masterly strategy of Lee was overcome only by the superior resources 
2 CONT and troop strength of the Union. His campaigns are almost universally 
2 CONT studied in military schools as models of strategy and tactics. He had a 
2 CONT capacity for anticipating the actions of his opponents and for 
2 CONT comprehending their weaknesses. He made skillful use of interior lines of 
2 CONT communication and kept a convex front toward the enemy, so that his 
2 CONT reinforcements, transfers, and supplies could reach their destination over 
2 CONT short, direct routes. His greatest contribution to military practice, 
2 CONT however, was his use of field fortifications as aids to maneuvering. He 
2 CONT recognized that a small body of soldiers, protected by entrenchments, can 
2 CONT hold an enemy force of many times their number, while the main body 
2 CONT outflanks the enemy or attacks a smaller force elsewhere. In his 
2 CONT application of this principle Lee was years ahead of his time; the tactic 
2 CONT was not fully understood or generally adopted until the 20th century. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Lee applied for but was never granted the official postwar amnesty. He 
2 CONT accepted the presidency of Washington College, now Washington and Lee 
2 CONT University, in the fall of 1865; within a few years it had become an 
2 CONT outstanding institution. He died there on October 12, 1870. Lee has long 
2 CONT been revered as an ideal by southerners and as a hero by all Americans. 
2 CONT His antebellum home is now known as Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee 
2 CONT Memorial, and is a national memorial. In 1975 Lee's citizenship was 
2 CONT restored posthumously by an act of the U.S. Congress.

1 NOTE Charles Martel (circa 688-741), Carolingian ruler of the Frankish kingdom 
2 CONT of Austrasia (in present northeastern France and southwestern Germany). 
2 CONT Charles, whose surname means the hammer, was the son of Pepin of Herstal 
2 CONT and the grandfather of Charlemagne. Pepin was mayor of the palace under 
2 CONT the last kings of the Merovingian dynasty. When he died in 714, Charles, 
2 CONT an illegitimate son, was imprisoned by his father's widow, but he escaped 
2 CONT in 715 and was proclaimed mayor of the palace by the Austrasians. A war 
2 CONT between Austrasia and the Frankish kingdom of Neustria (now part of 
2 CONT France) followed, and at the end of it Charles became the undisputed ruler 
2 CONT of all the Franks. Although he was engaged in wars against the Alamanni, 
2 CONT Bavarians, and Saxons, his greatest achievements were against the Muslims 
2 CONT from Spain, who invaded France in 732. Charles defeated them near Poitiers 
2 CONT in a great battle in which the Muslim leader, Abd-ar-Rahman, the emir of 
2 CONT Spain, was killed. The progress of Islam, which had filled all Christendom 
2 CONT with alarm, was thus checked for a time. Charles drove the Muslims out of 
2 CONT the Rhone valley in 739, when they had again advanced into France as far 
2 CONT as Lyon, leaving them nothing of their possessions north of the Pyrenees 
2 CONT beyond the Aude River. Charles died in Quierzy, on the Oise River, leaving 
2 CONT the kingdom divided between his two sons, Carloman (circa 715-54) and 
2 CONT Pepin the Short.

2 CONT during the reign of Childeric III (reigned about 743-52), the last of the 
2 CONT Merovingian dynasty. In 751, Pepin deposed Childeric and thus became the 
2 CONT first king of the Carolingian dynasty. He was crowned by Pope Stephen II 
2 CONT (III) in 754. When the pope was threatened by the Lombards of northern 
2 CONT Italy, Pepin led an army that defeated them (754-55). He ceded to the pope 
2 CONT territory that included Ravenna and other cities. This grant, called the 
2 CONT Donation of Pepin, laid the foundation for the Papal States. Pepin 
2 CONT enlarged his own kingdom by capturing Aquitaine, or Aquitania, in 
2 CONT southwestern France. He was succeeded by his sons Carloman and Charlemagne 
2 CONT as joint kings.

1 NOTE He was the first to rule, at least nominally, the entire country. Harold 
2 CONT inherited three small domains in eastern, central, and western Norway from 
2 CONT his father, and set out to conquer the rest of the country, spurred -- 
2 CONT according to the saga tradition -- by the refusal of another petty king's 
2 CONT daughter to marry him until all of Norway was under his sway. After many 
2 CONT years of campaigning, during which the chieftains of western Norway 
2 CONT offered the most stubborn resistance, Harold gained his final victory in 
2 CONT the Battle of Hafrsfjord, which probably took place around 885, although 
2 CONT it may have been some years later. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Once in power, Harold ruled with a strong hand and consolidated his realm. 
2 CONT One result of his firm rule was the acceleration of the immigration that 
2 CONT had begun shortly before to pioneer settlements in Iceland. Many 
2 CONT chieftains also fled to the Western (British) Isles, from where they and 
2 CONT their kinsfolk in the Orkneys, Shetlands, and Hebrides raided the 
2 CONT Norwegian coast. Harold was finally compelled to send a punitive 
2 CONT expedition across the North Sea to flush out these Vikings. For the same 
2 CONT purpose he entered into an alliance with King Æthelstan of England; but he 
2 CONT made no actual conquests. In his old age Harold abdicated in favor of his 
2 CONT eldest legitimate son, Eric Bloodaxe, who was deposed by his half brother 
2 CONT Håkon I after a few years of misrule.

1 NOTE Constantine the Great (about ad 274-337), Roman emperor (306-37), the 
2 CONT first Roman ruler to be converted to Christianity. He was the founder of 
2 CONT Constantinople (present-day Ìstanbul), which remained the capital of the 
2 CONT Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire until 1453. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Life
2 CONT 
2 CONT Constantine was born Flavius Valerius Constantinus at Nis in what is now 
2 CONT Yugoslavia, son of the commander Constantius Chlorus (later Constantius I) 
2 CONT and Helena (later Saint Helena), a camp follower. Constantius became 
2 CONT co-emperor in 305. Constantine, who had shown military talent in the East, 
2 CONT joined his father in Britain in 306. He was popular with the troops, who 
2 CONT proclaimed him emperor when Constantius died later the same year. Over the 
2 CONT next two decades, however, Constantine had to fight his rivals for the 
2 CONT throne, and he did not finally establish himself as sole ruler until 324. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Following the example of his father and earlier 3d-century emperors, 
2 CONT Constantine in his early life was a solar henotheist, believing that the 
2 CONT Roman sun god, Sol, was the visible manifestation of an invisible Highest 
2 CONT God (summus deus), who was the principle behind the universe. This god 
2 CONT was thought to be the companion of the Roman emperor. Constantine's 
2 CONT adherence to this faith is evident from his claim of having had a vision 
2 CONT of the sun god in 310 while in a grove of Apollo in Gaul. In 312, on the 
2 CONT eve of a battle against Maxentius (circa 250-312), his rival in Italy, 
2 CONT Constantine is reported to have dreamed that Christ appeared to him and 
2 CONT told him to inscribe the first two letters of his name (XP in Greek) on 
2 CONT the shields of his troops. The next day he is said to have seen a cross 
2 CONT superimposed on the sun and the words in this sign you will be the 
2 CONT victor (usually given in Latin, in hoc signo vinces). Constantine then 
2 CONT defeated Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, near Rome. The 
2 CONT Senate hailed the victor as savior of the Roman people. Thus, Constantine, 
2 CONT who had been a pagan solar worshiper, now looked upon the Christian deity 
2 CONT as a bringer of victory. Persecution of the Christians was ended, and 
2 CONT Constantine's co-emperor, Licinius (270?-325), joined him in issuing the 
2 CONT Edict of Milan (313), which mandated toleration of Christians in the Roman 
2 CONT Empire. As guardian of Constantine's favored religion, the church was then 
2 CONT given legal rights and large financial donations. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Sole Ruler
2 CONT 
2 CONT A struggle for power soon began between Licinius and Constantine, from 
2 CONT which Constantine emerged in 324 as a victorious Christian champion. Now 
2 CONT emperor of both East and West, he began to implement important 
2 CONT administrative reforms. The army was reorganized, and the separation of 
2 CONT civil and military authority, begun by his predecessor, Diocletian, was 
2 CONT completed. The central government was run by Constantine and his council, 
2 CONT known as the sacrum consistorium. The Senate was given back the powers 
2 CONT that it had lost in the 3d century, and new gold coins (solidi) were 
2 CONT issued, which remained the standard of exchange until the end of the 
2 CONT Byzantine Empire. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Constantine intervened in ecclesiastical affairs to achieve unity; he 
2 CONT presided over the first ecumenical council of the church at Nicaea in 325. 
2 CONT He also began the building of Constantinople in 326 on the site of ancient 
2 CONT Greek Byzantium. The city was completed in 330 (later expanded), given 
2 CONT Roman institutions, and beautified by ancient Greek works of art. In 
2 CONT addition, Constantine built churches in the Holy Land, where his mother 
2 CONT (also a Christian) supposedly found the True Cross on which Jesus was 
2 CONT crucified. The emperor was baptized shortly before his death, on May 22, 
2 CONT 337. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Evaluation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Constantine unified a tottering empire, reorganized the Roman state, and 
2 CONT set the stage for the final victory of Christianity at the end of the 4th 
2 CONT century. Many modern scholars accept the sincerity of his religious 
2 CONT conviction. His conversion was a gradual process; at first he probably 
2 CONT associated Christ with the victorious sun god. By the time of the Council 
2 CONT of Nicaea (325), however, he was completely Christian, but still tolerated 
2 CONT paganism among his subjects. Although criticized by his enemies as a 
2 CONT proponent of a crude and false religion, Constantine strengthened the 
2 CONT Roman Empire and ensured its survival in the East. As the first emperor to 
2 CONT rule in the name of Christ, he was a major figure in the foundation of 
2 CONT medieval Christian Europe.

1 NOTE Also th commander in chief of the Continental army during the American 
2 CONT Revolution. He symbolized qualities of discipline, aristocratic duty, 
2 CONT military orthodoxy, and persistence in adversity that his contemporaries 
2 CONT particularly valued as marks of mature political leadership. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT After his father's death, he moved to Mount Vernon, a large estate in 
2 CONT Fairfax County, the home of his elder half brother Lawrence (1718-52). 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although Washington had little or no formal schooling, his early notebooks 
2 CONT indicate that he read widely in geography, military history, agriculture, 
2 CONT deportment, and composition and that he showed some aptitude in surveying 
2 CONT and simple mathematics. In later life he developed a style of speech and 
2 CONT writing that, although not always polished, was marked by clarity and 
2 CONT force. Tall, strongly built, and fond of action, he was a superb horseman 
2 CONT and enjoyed the robust sports and social occasions of the planter society 
2 CONT in which he moved. At the age of 17 he was invited to join a party to 
2 CONT survey lands owned by the Fairfax family (to which he was related by 
2 CONT marriage) west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. His journey led him to take a 
2 CONT lifelong interest in the development of western lands. In the summer of 
2 CONT 1749 he was appointed official surveyor for Culpeper County, and during 
2 CONT the next two years he made many surveys for landowners on the Virginia 
2 CONT frontier. In 1753 he was appointed adjutant of one of the districts into 
2 CONT which Virginia was divided, with the rank of major. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Military Experience
2 CONT 
2 CONT Washington played an important role in the struggles preceding the 
2 CONT outbreak of the French and Indian War. He was chosen by Lieutenant 
2 CONT Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia to deliver an ultimatum calling on 
2 CONT French forces to cease their encroachment in the Ohio River valley. The 
2 CONT young messenger was also instructed to observe the strength of French 
2 CONT forces, the location of their forts, and the routes by which they might be 
2 CONT reinforced from Canada. After successfully completing this mission, 
2 CONT Washington, then a lieutenant colonel, was ordered to lead a militia force 
2 CONT for the protection of workers who were building a fort at the Forks of the 
2 CONT Ohio River. Having learned that the French had ousted the work party and 
2 CONT renamed the site Fort Duquesne, he entrenched his forces at a camp named 
2 CONT Fort Necessity and awaited reinforcements. A successful French assault 
2 CONT obliged him to accept articles of surrender, and he departed with the 
2 CONT remnants of his company. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Washington resigned his commission in 1754, but in May of the next year he 
2 CONT began service as an unpaid volunteer aide-de-camp to the British general 
2 CONT Edward Braddock, who had been sent to Virginia with a force of British 
2 CONT regulars. A few kilometers from Fort Duquesne, Braddock's men were 
2 CONT ambushed by a band of French soldiers and Indians. Braddock was mortally 
2 CONT wounded, and Washington, who behaved gallantly during the conflict, 
2 CONT narrowly escaped death. In August 1755 he was appointed (with the rank of 
2 CONT colonel) to command the Virginia militia, charged with the defense of the 
2 CONT long western frontier of the colony. War between France and Britain was 
2 CONT officially declared in May 1756, and while the principal struggle moved to 
2 CONT other areas, Washington succeeded in keeping the Virginia frontier 
2 CONT relatively safe. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The American Revolution
2 CONT     
2 CONT After the death of his half brother Lawrence, Washington inherited Mount 
2 CONT Vernon. A spectacular rise in the price of tobacco during the 1730s and 
2 CONT '40s, combined with his marriage in 1759 to Martha Custis, a young widow 
2 CONT with a large estate, made him one of the wealthiest men in Virginia. 
2 CONT Elected to the House of Burgesses in 1758, he served conscientiously but 
2 CONT without special distinction for more than a decade. He also gained wide 
2 CONT legal and administrative experience as justice of the peace for Fairfax 
2 CONT County. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Like other Virginia planters, Washington became alarmed by the repressive 
2 CONT measures of the British crown and Parliament in the 1760s and early '70s. 
2 CONT In July 1774 he presided over a meeting in Alexandria that adopted the 
2 CONT Fairfax Resolves, calling for the establishment and enforcement of a 
2 CONT stringent boycott on British imports prior to similar action by the First 
2 CONT Continental Congress. Together with his service in the House of Burgesses, 
2 CONT his public response to unpopular British policies won Washington election 
2 CONT as a Virginia delegate to the First Continental Congress in September and 
2 CONT October 1774 and to the Second Continental Congress the following year. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Opening Campaigns of the War
2 CONT     
2 CONT When fighting broke out between Massachusetts and the British in 1775, 
2 CONT Congress named Washington commander of its newly created Continental army, 
2 CONT hoping thus to promote unity between New England and Virginia. He took 
2 CONT command of the makeshift force besieging the British in Boston in 
2 CONT mid-July, and when the enemy evacuated the city in March 1776, he moved 
2 CONT his army to New York. Defeated there in August by a superior force under 
2 CONT Sir William Howe, he withdrew from Manhattan to establish a new defensive 
2 CONT line north of New York City. In November he retreated across the Hudson 
2 CONT River into New Jersey, and a month later crossed the Delaware to safety in 
2 CONT Pennsylvania. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Although demoralized by Howe's easy capture of New York City and northern 
2 CONT New Jersey, Washington spotted the points where the British were 
2 CONT overextended. Recrossing the icy Delaware on the night of December 25, 
2 CONT 1776, he captured Trenton in a surprise attack the following morning, and 
2 CONT on January 3, 1777, he defeated British troops at Princeton. These two 
2 CONT engagements restored patriot morale, and by spring Washington had 8000 new 
2 CONT recruits. Impressed by such tenacity, Howe delayed moving against 
2 CONT Washington until late August, when he landed an army at the head of 
2 CONT Chesapeake Bay. The American commander tried unsuccessfully to block 
2 CONT Howe's advance toward Philadelphia at the Battle of Brandywine Creek in 
2 CONT September. Following the British occupation of the city, he fought a minor 
2 CONT battle with them at Germantown, but their superior numbers forced him to 
2 CONT retreat. Washington and his men spent the following winter at Valley 
2 CONT Forge, west of Philadelphia. During these months, when his fortunes seemed 
2 CONT to have reached their lowest point, he thwarted a plan by his enemies in 
2 CONT Congress and the army to have him removed as commander in chief. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In June 1778, after France's entry into the war on the American side, the 
2 CONT new British commander, Sir Henry Clinton, evacuated Philadelphia and 
2 CONT marched overland to New York; Washington attacked him at Monmouth, New 
2 CONT Jersey, but was again repulsed. Washington blamed the defeat on General 
2 CONT Charles Lee's insubordination during the battle, the climax of a 
2 CONT long-brewing rivalry between the two men. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Victory
2 CONT 
2 CONT Washington spent the next two years in relative inactivity with his army 
2 CONT encamped in a long semicircle around the British bastion of New York 
2 CONT Cityfrom Connecticut to New Jersey. The arrival in 1780 of about 6000 
2 CONT French troops in Rhode Island under the comte de Rochambeau augmented his 
2 CONT forces, but the weak U.S. government was approaching bankruptcy, and 
2 CONT Washington knew that he had to defeat the British in 1781 or see his army 
2 CONT disintegrate. He hoped for a combined American-French assault on New York, 
2 CONT but in August he received word that a French fleet was proceeding to 
2 CONT Cheseapeake Bay for a combined land and sea operation against another 
2 CONT British army in Virginia, and reluctantly agreed to march south. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Washington and Rochambeau's movement of 7000 troops, half of them French, 
2 CONT from New York State to Virginia in less than five weeks was a masterpiece 
2 CONT of execution. Washington sent word ahead to the marquis de Lafayette, 
2 CONT commanding American forces in Virginia, to keep the British commander, 
2 CONT Lord Cornwallis, from leaving his base of operations at Yorktown. At the 
2 CONT end of September the Franco-American army joined Lafayette. Outnumbering 
2 CONT the Br tish by two to one, and with 36 French ships offshore to prevent 
2 CONT Yorktown from being relieved by sea, Washington forced Cornwallis to 
2 CONT surrender in October after a brief siege. Although peace and British 
2 CONT recognition of United States independence did not come for another two 
2 CONT years, Yorktown proved to be the last battle of the American Revolution. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Washington as a Military Leader
2 CONT 
2 CONT Washington's contribution to American victory was enormous, and analysis 
2 CONT of his leadership reveals much about the nature of the military and 
2 CONT political conflict. His tactic of avoiding major battles with the British 
2 CONT main force prevented his foes from using their strongest asset, the 
2 CONT professionalism and discipline of their soldiers. At the same time, 
2 CONT however, Washington remained a conventional military officer. He rejected 
2 CONT the proposals made by General Charles Lee early in the war for a 
2 CONT decentralized guerrilla struggle. As a conservative, he shrank from the 
2 CONT social dislocation and redistribution of wealth that such a conflict would 
2 CONT cause; as a provincial gentleman, he was determined to show that American 
2 CONT officers could be every bit as civilized and genteel as their European 
2 CONT counterparts. The practical result of this caution and even inhibition was 
2 CONT to preserve the Continental army as a visible manifestation of American 
2 CONT government when allegiance to that government was tenuous. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Political Leadership
2 CONT     
2 CONT In one of his last acts as commander, Washington issued a circular letter 
2 CONT to the states imploring them to form a vibrant, vigorous national 
2 CONT government. In 1783 he returned to Mount Vernon and became in the 
2 CONT mid-1780s one of the more enterprising and effective agriculturalists 
2 CONT among the Virginia aristocracy. Shays' Rebellion, an armed revolt in 
2 CONT Massachusetts (1786-87), convinced many Americans of the need for a 
2 CONT stronger government. Washington and other Virginia nationalists were 
2 CONT instrumental in bringing about the Constitutional Convention of 1787 to 
2 CONT promote that end. Elected as a delegate to the convention by the Virginia 
2 CONT General Assembly, Washington was chosen its president. In this position he 
2 CONT played virtually no role either formal or behind the scenes in the 
2 CONT deliberations of the convention; however, his reticence and lack of 
2 CONT intellectual flair may well have enhanced his objectivity in the eyes of 
2 CONT the delegates, thereby contributing to the unselfconscious give and take 
2 CONT that was the hallmark of the framers' deliberations. In addition, the high 
2 CONT probability that Washington would be the first president may have eased 
2 CONT the task of designing that office. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT First Administration
2 CONT 
2 CONT Elected president in 1788 and again in 1792, Washington presided over the 
2 CONT formation and initial operation of the new government. His stiff dignity 
2 CONT and sense of propriety postponed the emergence of the fierce partisanship 
2 CONT that would characterize the administrations of his three immediate 
2 CONT successors: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. He also made 
2 CONT several decisions of far-reaching importance. First, he created the 
2 CONT cabinet, although no such body was envisioned by the Constitution. By 
2 CONT appointing Alexander Hamilton secretary of the treasury and Thomas 
2 CONT Jefferson secretary of state, he brought the two ablest and most 
2 CONT principled figures of the revolutionary generation into central positions 
2 CONT of responsibility. Washington vigorously supported the innovations in 
2 CONT fiscal policy proposed by Hamilton: a funded national debt, the creation 
2 CONT of the Bank of the United States, assumption of state debts, and excise 
2 CONT taxes, especially on whiskey, by which the federal government would assert 
2 CONT its power to levy controversial taxes and import duties high enough to pay 
2 CONT the interest on the new national debt. Similarly, he allowed Jefferson to 
2 CONT pursue a policy of seeking trade and cooperation with all European 
2 CONT nations. Washington did not foresee that Hamilton's and Jefferson's 
2 CONT policies were ultimately incompatible. Hamilton's plan for an expanding 
2 CONT national debt yielding an attractive rate of return for investors depended 
2 CONT on a high level of trade with Britain generating enough import-duty 
2 CONT revenue to service the debt. Hamilton therefore felt that he had to meddle 
2 CONT in foreign policy to the extent of leaking secret dispatches to the 
2 CONT British. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Second Administration
2 CONT 
2 CONT The outbreak of war between revolutionary France and a coalition led by 
2 CONT Britain, Prussia, and Austria in 1793 jeopardized American foreign policy 
2 CONT and crippled Jefferson's rival foreign policy design. When the French 
2 CONT envoy, Edmund Genêt, arrived in Charleston in April 1793 and began 
2 CONT recruiting American privateers and promising aid to land speculators who 
2 CONT wanted French assistance in expelling Spain from the Gulf Coast Washington 
2 CONT insisted, over Jefferson's reservations, that the U.S. denounce Genêt and 
2 CONT repudiate its 1778 treaty with France. Washington's anti-French leanings, 
2 CONT coupled with the aggressive attitude of the new regime in France toward 
2 CONT the U.S., thus served to bring about the triumph of Hamilton's pro-British 
2 CONT foreign policy a posture formalized by Jay's Treaty of 1795, which settled 
2 CONT outstanding American differences with Britain. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The treaty, which many Americans felt contained too many concessions to 
2 CONT the British, touched off a storm of controversy. The Senate ratified it, 
2 CONT but opponents in the House of Representatives tried to block 
2 CONT appropriations to establish the arbitration machinery. In a rare display 
2 CONT of political pugnacity, Washington challenged the propriety of the House 
2 CONT tampering with treaty making. His belligerence on this occasion cost him 
2 CONT his prized reputation as a leader above party, but it was also decisive in 
2 CONT securing a 51-48 vote by the House to implement the treaty. Conscious of 
2 CONT the value of his formative role in shaping the presidency and certainly 
2 CONT stung by the invective hurled at advocates of the Jay Treaty, Washington 
2 CONT carefully prepared a farewell address to mark the end of his presidency, 
2 CONT calling on the U.S. to avoid both entangling alliances and party rancor. 
2 CONT After leaving office in 1797, Washington retired to Mount Vernon.
2 CONT     
2 CONT Evaluation
2 CONT 
2 CONT Washington's place in the American mind is a fascinating chapter in the 
2 CONT intellectual life of the nation. Shortly after the president's death, an 
2 CONT Episcopal clergyman, Mason Locke Weems, wrote a fanciful life of 
2 CONT Washington for children, stressing the great man's honesty, piety, hard 
2 CONT work, patriotism, and wisdom. This book, which went through many editions, 
2 CONT popularized the story that Washington as a boy had refused to lie in order 
2 CONT to avoid punishment for cutting down his father's cherry tree. Throughout 
2 CONT most of the Victorian era, Washington's example served as one of the 
2 CONT symbols of American identity along with the flag, the Constitution, and 
2 CONT the Fourth of July. The age of debunking biographies of American 
2 CONT personages in the 1920s included a multivolume denigration of Washington 
2 CONT by the American author Rupert Hughes (1872-1956). Both the hero worship 
2 CONT and the debunking miss the essential point that his leadership abilities 
2 CONT and his personal principles were exactly the ones that met the needs of 
2 CONT his own generation. As later historians have examined closely the ideas of 
2 CONT the Founding Fathers and the nature of warfare in the Revolution, they 
2 CONT have come to the conclusion that Washington's specific contributions to 
2 CONT the new nation were, if anything, somewhat underestimated by earlier 
2 CONT scholarship.

1 NOTE The first of the Saxon line of German kings. In 912 Henri succeeded his 
2 CONT father as duke of Saxony. Following the death of Conrad I, king of 
2 CONT Germany, in 918, Henri was chosen king by the Franconian and Saxon nobles. 
2 CONT Bavaria, Swabia, and Lotharingia refused to acknowledge him at first, and 
2 CONT it was not until 925 that he managed to win recognition from all the 
2 CONT German states. In 926 Henri secured a nine-year truce from warfare with 
2 CONT the Magyars. During that period he transformed many of the small towns of 
2 CONT Germany into fortified cities with trained troops of mounted warriors. His 
2 CONT military preparations were successfully tested in a war against the Wends 
2 CONT in 929. When the Magyars invaded Thuringia in 933, Henri repulsed them 
2 CONT decisively. He defeated the Danes in the following year and seized 
2 CONT territory from them. Henri was the first to create a united Germany, and, 
2 CONT although he never received the imperial crown, he is generally recognized 
2 CONT as one of the Holy Roman emperors. He was succeeded by his son, Otto.

1 NOTE He was called The Saint.  In 1217 Ferdinand's mother, Berengaria, 
2 CONT renounced her title to the Castilian throne in favor of her son. Alfonso 
2 CONT IX, who had himself expected to acquire Castile, was angered at his wife's 
2 CONT action, and, aided by a group of Castilian nobles favorable to his claim, 
2 CONT made war upon his newly crowned son. Ferdinand, however, with the wise 
2 CONT counsel of his mother, proved more than a military match for Alfonso, who 
2 CONT at length was forced to abandon his plan of conquering Castile. Through 
2 CONT the good offices of Berengaria, Ferdinand was able to effect the peaceful 
2 CONT union of León and Castile upon the death of his father in 1230. Ferdinand 
2 CONT devoted his energies to prosecuting the war against the Moors, conquering 
2 CONT Cordoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. He was rigorous in his suppression of 
2 CONT the heretical Albigenses, a fact largely responsible for his canonization 
2 CONT more than two centuries later. In 1242 Ferdinand reestablished at 
2 CONT Salamanca the university originally founded by his grandfather.

1 NOTE Mary (Virgin Mary), also the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, 
2 CONT venerated by Christians since apostolic times. The Gospels give only a 
2 CONT fragmentary account of Mary, mentioning her chiefly in connection with the 
2 CONT beginning and the end of Jesus' life. Matthew speaks of Mary as Joseph's 
2 CONT wife, who is "with child of the Holy Spirit" before they "came together" 
2 CONT as husband and wife (see Matthew 1:18). After the birth of Jesus, she is 
2 CONT present at the visit of the Magi (see Matthew 2:11), flees with Joseph in 
2 CONT Egypt (see Matt. 2:14), and returns to Nazareth (see Matt. 2:23). Mark 
2 CONT simply refers to Jesus as the son of Mary (see Mark 6:3). Luke's narrative 
2 CONT of the nativity includes the angel Gabriel announcing to Mary the coming 
2 CONT birth of Jesus (see Luke 1:27-38); her visit to her kinswoman Elizabeth, 
2 CONT mother of John the Baptist, and Mary's hymn, the Magnificat (see Luke 
2 CONT 1:39-56); and the shepherds' visit to the manger (see Luke 2:1-20). Luke 
2 CONT also tells of Mary's perplexity at finding Jesus in the Temple questioning 
2 CONT the teachers when he was 12 years old. The Gospel of John contains no 
2 CONT infancy narrative, nor does it mention Mary's name; she is referred to as 
2 CONT the mother of Jesus (see John 2, 19). She is present at the first of 
2 CONT Jesus' miracles at the wedding feast of Cana (2:1,3,5) and at his death 
2 CONT (19:25-27). Mary is also mentioned as being present in the upper room at 
2 CONT Olivet with the apostles and with Jesus' brothers before Pentecost (see 
2 CONT Acts 1:14). 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Early Church
2 CONT 
2 CONT As early as the 2d century Christians venerated Mary by calling her Mother 
2 CONT of God, a title that primarily stresses the divinity of Jesus. During the 
2 CONT 4th-century controversies concerning the divine and human natures of 
2 CONT Jesus, the Greek title Theotokos (Mother of God) came to be used for Mary 
2 CONT in devotional and theological writing. The Syrian monk Nestorius (died 
2 CONT about 451) contested this usage, insisting that Mary was mother of Christ, 
2 CONT not of God. The Council of Ephesus (431) condemned Nestorius's teaching 
2 CONT and solemnly affirmed that Mary is to be called Theotokos, a title that 
2 CONT has been used since that time in the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Closely allied with the title Mother of God is the title Virgin Mary, 
2 CONT affirming the virginal conception of Jesus (see Luke 1:35). Initially, 
2 CONT this title stressed the belief that God, not Joseph, was the true Father 
2 CONT of Jesus. In the Marian devotion that developed in the East in the 4th 
2 CONT century Mary was venerated not only in the conception, but also in the 
2 CONT birth of Jesus. This conviction was expressed clearly in the 4th century 
2 CONT baptismal creeds of Cyprus, Syria, Palestine, and Armenia (373-74). The 
2 CONT title used was Aieiparthenos (ever-virgin), and by the middle of the 7th 
2 CONT century the understanding of the title came to include the conviction that 
2 CONT Mary remained a virgin for the whole of her life. The passages in the New 
2 CONT Testament referring to the brothers of Jesus (for instance, Mark 6:3, 
2 CONT which also mentions sisters; see 1 Corinthians 9:5; Galatians 1:19) have 
2 CONT been accordingly explained as references to relatives of Jesus or to 
2 CONT children of Joseph by a previous marriage, although no textual evidence 
2 CONT supports these interpretations. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Beginning in the 2d and 3d centuries Mary was called Holy or Blessed 
2 CONT Virgin to express the belief that, because of her intimate union with God 
2 CONT through the Holy Spirit in the conception of Jesus (see Luke 1:35), Mary 
2 CONT was completely free from any taint of sin. A Roman Council in 680 spoke of 
2 CONT her as the blessed, immaculate ever-virgin. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In both the Eastern and Western churches, feast days in honor of the 
2 CONT events of Mary's life came into existence between the 4th and 7th 
2 CONT centuries. They celebrate her miraculous conception and her birth, 
2 CONT narrated in the apocryphal protogospel of James (September 8), the 
2 CONT Annunciation (March 25), her purification in the Temple (February 2), and 
2 CONT her death (called the Dormition in the Eastern church) and bodily 
2 CONT assumption into heaven (August 15; see Assumption of the Virgin). 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Middle Ages
2 CONT 
2 CONT During the late Middle Ages (13th-15th century) devotion to Mary grew 
2 CONT vigorously. One of the principal reasons was the image of Christ that 
2 CONT developed in the missionary efforts of the early Middle Ages. To the 
2 CONT extent that the Gothic and other tribes of central and northern Europe 
2 CONT were Christian, they remained strongly influenced by Arianism, a teaching 
2 CONT that denied the divinity of Christ. In response, preaching and the arts of 
2 CONT this period particularly stressed Christ's divinity, as in the Byzantine 
2 CONT depictions of Christ as Pantokrator (universal and all-powerful ruler) 
2 CONT and in the western images of Christ as the supreme and universal judge. As 
2 CONT Christ became an awe-inspiring, judgmental figure, Mary came to be 
2 CONT depicted as the one who interceded for sinners. As the fear of death and 
2 CONT the Last Judgment intensified following the Black Plague in the 14th 
2 CONT century, Mary was increasingly venerated in popular piety as mediator of 
2 CONT the mercy of Christ. Her prayers and pleas were seen as the agency that 
2 CONT tempered the stern justice of Christ. Among the popular devotions that 
2 CONT came into being at this time were the rosary; (a chaplet originally 
2 CONT consisting of 150 Hail Marys in imitation of the 150 Psalms in the 
2 CONT psalter, later augmented by 15 interspersed Our Fathers as penance for 
2 CONT daily sins); the angelus recited at sunrise, noon, and sunset; and 
2 CONT litanies, invocations of Mary using such biblical titles as Mystical Rose, 
2 CONT Tower of David, and Refuge of Sinners (see Litany). Hymns, psalms, and 
2 CONT prayers were incorporated into the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, in 
2 CONT imitation of the longer divine office recited or chanted by monks and 
2 CONT priests. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Doctrine of Immaculate Conception
2 CONT 
2 CONT The principal theological development concerning Mary in the Middle Ages 
2 CONT was the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. This doctrine, defended and 
2 CONT preached by the Franciscan friars under the inspiration of the 13th 
2 CONT century Scottish theologian John Duns Scotus, maintains that Mary was 
2 CONT conceived without original sin. Dominican teachers and preachers 
2 CONT vigorously opposed the doctrine, maintaining that it detracted from 
2 CONT Christ's role as universal savior. Pope Sixtus IV, however, defended it, 
2 CONT establishing (1477) a feast of the Immaculate Conception with a proper 
2 CONT mass and office to be celebrated on December 8. This feast was extended to 
2 CONT the whole Western church by Pope Clement XI in 1708. In 1854 Pope Pius IX 
2 CONT issued a solemn decree defining the Immaculate Conception for all Roman 
2 CONT Catholics, but the doctrine has not been accepted by Protestants or by the 
2 CONT Orthodox churches. In 1950, Pope Pius XII solemnly defined as an article 
2 CONT of faith for all Roman Catholics the doctrine of the bodily assumption of 
2 CONT Mary into heaven. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Shrines
2 CONT 
2 CONT Marian shrines and places of pilgrimage are found throughout the world. At 
2 CONT Monserrat in Spain the Black Virgin has been venerated since the 12th 
2 CONT century. The icon of Our Lady of Czèstochowa has been venerated in Poland 
2 CONT since the early 14th century. The picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe 
2 CONT commemorates an alleged apparition of Mary to the Indian Juan Diego in 
2 CONT Mexico in 1531. In the 19th century a number of apparitions of Mary were 
2 CONT reported that inspired the development of shrines, devotions, and 
2 CONT pilgrimagesfor instance, in Paris (1830, Our Lady of the Miraculous 
2 CONT Medal), Lourdes (1858, Our Lady of Lourdes), Knock, in Ireland (1879, Our 
2 CONT Lady of Knock), and Fatima, in Portugal (1917, Our Lady of Fatima).

2 CONT books of Matthew and Luke. Several other passages mention him as the 
2 CONT father of Jesus Christ, and a few refer to him as a carpenter or an 
2 CONT artisan (see Matthew 13:55; Luke 3:23; John 1:45, 6:42). He was a 
2 CONT descendant of the royal line of David, and his family was from David's 
2 CONT town of Bethlehem. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Joseph, Mary, and Jesus settled in Nazareth. There, Christ grew up in his 
2 CONT household for 12 years. Joseph's last appearance in the Gospels occurs 
2 CONT when he and Mary find the 12-year-old Jesus in the Temple (see Luke 
2 CONT 2:41-51). Joseph was apparently dead by the time of Christ's passion. St. 
2 CONT Joseph is venerated by both the Orthodox and Roman Catholics; he is 
2 CONT regarded by the latter as the patron of the universal church. His feast 
2 CONT day is March 19, in the West, and the first Sunday after Christmas, in the

1 NOTE Towards the end of Magnus the Good's reign in Denmark, his claim to the 
2 CONT throne was disputed by Canute's nephew Sweyn Estridsen.  When Magnus died 
2 CONT in a supposed riding accident in 1047, Sweyn was elected his successor , 
2 CONT but was challenged in his turn by Harold Hardradi, the new King of Norway. 
2 CONT  Hardradi embarked on a number of raids on Sweyn's territories but could 
2 CONT not drive him from the throne.  In 1066 Hardradi turned his attentions to 
2 CONT England where he was slain at the Battle of Stamford Bridge by Sweyn's 
2 CONT cousin, the English King Harold Godwinsson.  When Harold was himself slain 
2 CONT later in the year, Sweyn took in his daughter, Gytha Haroldsdotter, and 
2 CONT later gave her in marriage to Vladimir II, Grand Duke of Kiev.  In 1070 
2 CONT Sweyn and King Emund of Sweden agreed on a frontier between the two 
2 CONT countries that was respected until the 1600's.  In the 1070's Adam of 
2 CONT Bremen wrote "History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen" which 
2 CONT described the Danes as arrogant and addicted to food, strong drink, and 
2 CONT women.  Sweyn was himself described as pious and learned, but it is 
2 CONT obvious he shared many of his countrymen's vices: he indulged in much 
2 CONT feasting, had at least fifteen illegitimate children by various 
2 CONT mistresses, and permitted pirates to establish themselves on an island 
2 CONT between Fyn and Zealand.  Sweyn died in 1076 after what must be considered 
2 CONT a successful reign.  In spite of four marriages he left no legitimate 
2 CONT heirs, and the throne was disputed by two bastard sons--Harald and Knut.

1 NOTE Jefferson, Thomas (1743-1826), American revolutionary leader and political 
2 CONT philosopher, author of the Declaration of Independence, and third 
2 CONT president of the United States. (1801-09). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jefferson was among the most brilliant American exponents of the 
2 CONT Enlightenment, the movement of 18th-century thought that emphasized the 
2 CONT possibilities of human reason. A Virginia aristocrat, he had the time and 
2 CONT resources to educate himself in history, literature, law, architecture, 
2 CONT science, and philosophy; as a diplomat and friend of French and British 
2 CONT intellectuals, he had direct access to European culture and thought; and 
2 CONT as a provincial farmer and novice revolutionary leader, he had the 
2 CONT motivation and the opportunity to construct a social and political 
2 CONT philosophy for his neighbors and his country. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Life
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, at Shadwell in Albemarle County, 
2 CONT Virginia. His father was a plantation owner, and his mother belonged to 
2 CONT the Randolph family, which was prominent in colonial Virginia. From his 
2 CONT father and from his environment he acquired an intense interest in botany, 
2 CONT geology, cartography, and North American exploration, and from a childhood 
2 CONT teacher a love of Greek and Latin. As a student at the College of William 
2 CONT and Mary in the early 1760s, he studied under William Small, who knew in 
2 CONT depth the Scottish Enlightenment, with its highly integrated approach to 
2 CONT law, history, philosophy, and science. In George Wythe, he found an 
2 CONT equally gifted teacher of the law. Jefferson was admitted to the bar in 
2 CONT 1767 and first elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1769. His 
2 CONT principal passion during his late 20s was the design and building of his 
2 CONT home, Monticello, along lines inspired by the Renaissance Italian 
2 CONT architect Palladio. Despite several desultory courtships, he did not 
2 CONT seriously consider marriage until 1770, when he met Martha Wayles Skelton 
2 CONT (1747-82), a wealthy widow of 23. They were married in 1772. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Theoretician of Independence
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jefferson's long bachelorhood gave him the time during his 20s for 
2 CONT voracious reading in Enlightenment philosophy, 17th-century English 
2 CONT history, political theory, and law. Drawing on this learning, he drafted 
2 CONT in 1774 a Summary View of the Rights of British America as instructions 
2 CONT for Virginia's delegates to the First Continental Congress, which met to 
2 CONT consider the colonies' grievances against Great Britain. Virginia leaders 
2 CONT instead adopted a more legalistic set of instructions, and Summary View 
2 CONT was published anonymously as a pamphlet. As Jefferson's authorship became 
2 CONT widely known, however, he moved suddenly into the front rank of American 
2 CONT political theorists. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In the pamphlet, Jefferson argued that the original settlers of the 
2 CONT colonies came as individuals rather than as agents of the British 
2 CONT government. The colonial governments they formed therefore embodied the 
2 CONT natural right of expatriates from one country to select the terms of their 
2 CONT subjection to a new ruler. Colonial legislatures and the British 
2 CONT Parliament, he asserted, shared power, and both were responsible for 
2 CONT protecting the "liberties and rights" of the people. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Declaration of Independence, drafted principally by Jefferson in late 
2 CONT June 1776 for the Second Continental Congress, drew the implications of 
2 CONT this historical view to their logical conclusion, proclaiming that the 
2 CONT tyrannical acts of the British government gave the colonists the right to 
2 CONT "dissolve the political bands" that had connected them with the mother 
2 CONT country. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Legislative Achievements
2 CONT 
2 CONT As a legislator in Virginia (1776-79), Jefferson sought to reform society 
2 CONT along enlightened and republican lines. After successfully proposing the 
2 CONT disestablishment of the Anglican church, he was responsible for 
2 CONT legislation abolishing entail (inheritance of land through a particular 
2 CONT line of descent) and primogeniture (inheritance only by the eldest son), 
2 CONT thus eliminating two major governmental restrictions on the use of private 
2 CONT property. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The reform of the Virginia criminal code "in which Jefferson was a leading 
2 CONT participant" did not achieve the humanitarian results to which he was 
2 CONT dedicated but did eliminate the most barbarous and repressive practices, 
2 CONT such as public whippings, dunkings, and bills of attainder (which 
2 CONT condemned accused persons without trial). The legislature refused outright 
2 CONT to adopt Jefferson's bill for a public school system and library, but many 
2 CONT years later, in 1819, he succeeded in establishing the University of 
2 CONT Virginia, one of the three accomplishments that he memorialized in the 
2 CONT epitaph on his tombstone. The other two were his authorship of the 
2 CONT Declaration of Independence and of the Statute of Virginia for Religious 
2 CONT Freedom the latter the most important of his achievements as a Virginia 
2 CONT legislator. The religious freedom statute, originally introduced in 1779 
2 CONT but not actually passed by the legislature until 1786, prohibited any 
2 CONT state financing of religious instruction. Almost entirely composed of an 
2 CONT eloquent preface, it brilliantly excoriated the baneful effects of state 
2 CONT sponsorship of worship and belief. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT As governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, Jefferson failed to prevent the 
2 CONT British from invading the state. After leaving office he retreated to 
2 CONT Monticello to write his classic Notes on the State of Virginia. The Notes, 
2 CONT which were written for the information of a French correspondent, deal 
2 CONT with social, political, and economic life in the 18th century. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT After his wife's death in 1782, Jefferson again became a delegate to the 
2 CONT Congress, and in 1784 he drafted the report that was the basis for the 
2 CONT Ordinances of 1784, 1785, and 1787. As minister to France, from 1784 to 
2 CONT 1789, he steeped himself in French learning and witnessed, with excitement 
2 CONT and approval, the early stages of the French Revolution. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Washington and Adams Administrations
2 CONT 
2 CONT As secretary of state in Washington's first administration (1790-94), 
2 CONT Jefferson revived a proposal he had originated as a member of Congress in 
2 CONT 1783 to establish reciprocal trade agreements with continental European 
2 CONT nations and, in the face of British restrictions on American commerce, to 
2 CONT deny such benefits to the British. The proposal died in Congress. His 
2 CONT hopes for at least an evenhanded American approach to Britain and France 
2 CONT evaporated when the French envoy, Edmond Genêt, appealed to the public for 
2 CONT a military alliance with revolutionary France an indiscretion that made 
2 CONT Washington decide to repudiate the Franco-American alliance of 1778. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After leaving office, Jefferson was disturbed by the administration's 
2 CONT increasing friendliness to Great Britain and by other policies promoted by 
2 CONT Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. In 1796, he reluctantly allowed his 
2 CONT name to be put forward as a candidate for the presidency by the opposition 
2 CONT Republican party. He received the second largest number of votes among 
2 CONT four candidates and therefore, according to the electoral system then in 
2 CONT use, became vice-president under the Federalist president John Adams in 
2 CONT 1797. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During his term in that office he watched with growing indignation as the 
2 CONT Federalists capitalized on anti-French feeling to create a standing army 
2 CONT under the control of his enemy, Alexander Hamilton, and to pass the Alien 
2 CONT Acts, restricting the liberty of supposedly pro-Republican foreigners, and 
2 CONT the Sedition Act, which allowed the prosecution of anyone who printed 
2 CONT false statements critical of government officials. In resolutions drafted 
2 CONT for the Virginia and Kentucky legislatures, Jefferson and James Madison 
2 CONT denounced the constitutionality of these laws and assigned to the states 
2 CONT the role of bulwark against infringements on individual liberties. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Jefferson as President
2 CONT       
2 CONT In the election of 1800, Jefferson and his fellow Republican Aaron Burr 
2 CONT received an equal number of electoral votes, thus creating a tie and 
2 CONT throwing the presidential election into the House of Representatives. 
2 CONT After 36 ballots, the House declared Jefferson elected. (The Constitution 
2 CONT was then amended to require a single electoral vote for president and 
2 CONT vice-president.) 
2 CONT 
2 CONT As had Adams before him, Jefferson faced opposition from an uncompromising 
2 CONT faction within his own party as well as from the Federalists. He steered a 
2 CONT steady course between these two extremes, appointing some qualified 
2 CONT Federalists to office and refusing a wholesale purge of officeholders 
2 CONT inherited from the Adams administration. He supported repeal of the 
2 CONT Judiciary Act of 1801, which had created a costly tier of federal appeals 
2 CONT courts and would have encouraged appeals from state courts, but he opposed 
2 CONT any assault on the independence of the Federalist-dominated judiciary; 
2 CONT Jefferson's three appointments to the Supreme Court, made between 1804 and 
2 CONT 1807, were all strong nationalists and upholders of judicial independence. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During his first term his lifelong interest in the West and in 
2 CONT American-French relations prompted his major presidential achievement, the 
2 CONT purchase from France of Louisiana all the western land drained by the 
2 CONT Missouri and Mississippi rivers and the organization of a scientific 
2 CONT expedition by William Clark and Meriwether Lewis to explore this 
2 CONT territory. Foreign policy during his second term was, however, a disaster. 
2 CONT Seeking to force the British to respect U.S. neutrality on the high seas 
2 CONT during the Napoleonic Wars, he persuaded Congress in 1807 to embargo all 
2 CONT trade with Britaina move that failed to elicit any concessions, 
2 CONT devastated the nation's economy for a generation, and alienated New 
2 CONT England, which lived by foreign trade. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Retirement
2 CONT 
2 CONT After leaving office in 1809 he retired to Monticello, where he lived 
2 CONT until his death on July 4, 1826, corresponding with John Adams about the 
2 CONT great issues of revolution and constitutionalism, trying to preserve his 
2 CONT declining estate for his daughters instead of his creditors, and brooding 
2 CONT over the baneful effects of slavery. He was unwilling, for financial 
2 CONT reasons, to free his own slaves, and he disagreed with abolitionist 
2 CONT friends who held that blacks were equal to whites. His paradoxical beliefs 
2 CONT in human dignity and in racial inferiority typified the dilemma of the 
2 CONT country he had helped to create.

1 NOTE His administration marked a shift in national issues from those growing 
2 CONT out of the American Civil War to such concerns as civil service reform, 
2 CONT currency, and labor relations. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT His father had died before he was born, and his uncle, Sardis Birchard 
2 CONT (flourished 1834-74), financed his education at Kenyon College and Harvard 
2 CONT Law School. Hayes became a well-trained lawyer and developed a wide range 
2 CONT of intellectual tastes. After moving to Cincinnati in 1850 he married his 
2 CONT childhood sweetheart. Having entered politics as a Whig in 1851, he became 
2 CONT a Republican in 1855 and was elected city solicitor of Cincinnati in 1858. 
2 CONT Always a moderate on slavery, he nonetheless firmly opposed its extension. 
2 CONT When the Civil War came, Hayes joined the 23d Ohio Regiment. Beginning as 
2 CONT a major, he emerged from the war as a major general of volunteers with a 
2 CONT good combat record. He was easily elected to the House of Representatives 
2 CONT in 1864 and assumed office after the war ended. Two years later he left 
2 CONT the House to run successfully for governor of Ohio. Serving from 1868 to 
2 CONT 1872, he gained a national reputation as a competent, reform-minded 
2 CONT administrator. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Election of 1876
2 CONT 
2 CONT Defeated when he ran for Congress again in 1872, Hayes dropped briefly out 
2 CONT of politics, but recaptured the governorship in 1875. Thereafter his 
2 CONT political success, party loyalty, war record, and reputation for reform 
2 CONT opened wider vistas. The Republican national convention of 1876, wary of 
2 CONT the leading contender, James G. Blaine, whose name had been linked with 
2 CONT scandal, turned to Ohio's favorite son after six ballots. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT When the votes were counted, Hayes appeared to have lost the election to 
2 CONT Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York, but the Republicans contested 
2 CONT returns from four states. After a dramatic winter in which threats of 
2 CONT renewed civil war alternated with furious bargaining over issues of 
2 CONT southern home rule and economic development, a deal was struck, and the 
2 CONT Senate confirmed Hayes's title in March 1877. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Hayes Administration
2 CONT 
2 CONT Hayes moved quickly to assuage the South. He appointed a former 
2 CONT Confederate to his cabinet, distributed patronage to moderate southern 
2 CONT Democrats, and soon removed the last federal troops from the region. These 
2 CONT concessions alienated many Republicans. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Civil service reform further divided the party. Hayes issued an executive 
2 CONT order forbidding federal officeholders from taking part in party 
2 CONT management and protecting them from being assessed political 
2 CONT contributions. Enforcing this order on the New York customhouse, the 
2 CONT federal government's largest revenue-collection post, Hayes came into 
2 CONT conflict with Roscoe Conkling, leader of the New York party. Hayes carried 
2 CONT his point, but at the cost of more bitterness. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT A conservative on currency issues, Hayes considered the gold standard a 
2 CONT moral imperative analogous to paying one's debts. Even a popular 
2 CONT compromise measure to coin limited quantities of silver, the Bland-Allison 
2 CONT Act of 1878, had to be passed over his veto, and he firmly supported 
2 CONT Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman's successful efforts to give the 
2 CONT Civil War greenback dollars backing in gold. He was equally conservative 
2 CONT in his response to the labor disturbances of 1877, sending federal troops 
2 CONT to restore order and, in effect, to break strikes. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Hayes was a firm nationalist. Despite his conciliatory policy toward the 
2 CONT South, he consistently fought Democratic efforts to delimit the powers of 
2 CONT the national government and bipartisan attempts to curtail the powers of 
2 CONT the presidency. He was a cautious, judicious, eminently respectable 
2 CONT president, arousing little enthusiasm, but winning the somewhat grudging 
2 CONT admiration both of his contemporaries and of historians. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Choosing not to run for a second term, Hayes retired in 1881 to his home 
2 CONT in Fremont, Ohio.

1 NOTE He was the only chief executive to be reelected after defeat. Cleveland 
2 CONT adopted the credo "a public office is a public trust" and in his two 
2 CONT nonconsecutive terms spent much of his energies resisting partisan 
2 CONT influences and the political favoritism characteristic of that era. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT His family soon moved to from Caldwell to New York, settling in 
2 CONT Fayetteville and then Clinton, where this family of nine children 
2 CONT struggled on the father's modest salary. Prevented by his father's death 
2 CONT from attending college, Cleveland moved to an uncle's home near Buffalo, 
2 CONT New York, and clerked for a law firm. Studying by himself, he was admitted 
2 CONT to the bar in 1859. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Rise to Prominence in New York
2 CONT 
2 CONT In a series of minor political offices, Cleveland won a reputation for 
2 CONT scrupulous honesty. This earned him the Democratic nomination for mayor of 
2 CONT Buffalo in 1881, and he won the office on a reform platform. In his 
2 CONT inaugural address, he launched an attack on the notoriously corrupt board 
2 CONT of aldermen, and in the ensuing battles to reduce graft and break the 
2 CONT board's power, Cleveland earned the title of the Veto Mayor. With 
2 CONT bipartisan support in Buffalo, he became the Democratic nominee for 
2 CONT governor in 1882 and achieved an enormous victory. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Pursuing reform in his first year as governor, Cleveland found two of his 
2 CONT favorite bills stalled in the legislature by allies of New York City's 
2 CONT Democratic chairman, John Kelly (1822-86). In the subsequent conflict, the 
2 CONT city's Democrats became his permanent enemies. Cleveland experienced a 
2 CONT crisis of public support in his brief tenure as governor when he vetoed a 
2 CONT bill that would have reduced the fare on elevated railroads in New York 
2 CONT City. The public favored the lower rate, but the change would have 
2 CONT violated the company's charter. When Assemblyman Theodore Roosevelt (later 
2 CONT president) reversed his vote and supported Cleveland, the governor won. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1884 Cleveland's supporters proposed that he run for president. The 
2 CONT Republican convention had chosen as its candidate James G. Blaine, whose 
2 CONT political career had been marred by suggestions of corruption in aiding 
2 CONT the railroad industry years before. A sizable reform faction in the 
2 CONT Republican party, however, opposed Blaine's nomination, and they seceded, 
2 CONT earning the label Mugwumps. They promised to vote for the yet unchosen 
2 CONT Democratic candidate if he supported reform. Cleveland's past public 
2 CONT service therefore made him the likely candidate despite Tammany's 
2 CONT opposition. The promise of Mugwump votes swayed enough delegates to give 
2 CONT him the needed margin. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT First Term as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Cleveland won the election after a close race that was marred by various 
2 CONT personal accusations against both candidates. Taking office in 1885, he 
2 CONT resisted the petitions of thousands of party members and supporters for 
2 CONT jobs and continued the civil service reforms begun by his predecessor, 
2 CONT Chester A. Arthur. This disappointed many Democrats who were hoping for 
2 CONT lucrative jobs after 24 years of Republican rule. In 1887 Cleveland 
2 CONT persuaded Congress to repeal the Tenure of Office Act, which had 
2 CONT restricted the president's right to dismiss federal officeholders without 
2 CONT the consent of the Senate. This left him free to remove officials 
2 CONT appointed by the previous administration before their terms expired, to 
2 CONT carry out reforms in government agencies, and to reassert the independence 
2 CONT of the president's powers. In two other controversial moves, he vetoed a 
2 CONT general pension bill that would have allowed American Civil War veterans 
2 CONT to collect pensions for disabilities suffered after they had left the 
2 CONT army, and he opposed protective tariffs on imported goods. Cleveland 
2 CONT narrowly lost the election of 1888 to the Republican Benjamin Harrison 
2 CONT despite winning a majority of the popular vote. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Second Term
2 CONT 
2 CONT Under the Harrison administration, inflation increased the price of 
2 CONT consumer goods, and public sentiment turned against the protective tariff 
2 CONT the Republicans passed in 1890. Cleveland was persuaded to seek office 
2 CONT again in 1892, and he ran on an antitariff platform. Winning the election, 
2 CONT he returned to Washington in 1893 to face the beginnings of a depression. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Silver and Tariff Issues
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Sherman Act of 1890, designed to stimulate the silver industry in the 
2 CONT West, compelled the Treasury Department to buy 4.5 million oz of silver 
2 CONT each month. Greenbacks and treasury notes were used to buy the silver and, 
2 CONT to maintain parity, were redeemable in gold or silver. Economic panic in 
2 CONT 1893 created a run on treasury reserves of gold as the value of silver 
2 CONT fell. The purchase of silver then contributed to the outflow of gold and 
2 CONT threatened monetary disaster. Cleveland sought legislation to repeal the 
2 CONT Sherman Act. In the months of congressional infighting he lost the support 
2 CONT of a large faction of western and southern Democrats, led by William 
2 CONT Jennings Bryan, who favored free silver coinage. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Cleveland worked to reduce the so-called McKinley Tariff, which had 
2 CONT protected some American goods from competition but harmed other industries 
2 CONT that needed imported materials. The Democrats' tariff bill was so weakened 
2 CONT in the Senate, however, that when it emerged as the Wilson-Gorman Act, 
2 CONT Cleveland refused to sign it, and it became law without his endorsement. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Pullman Strike and the Election of 1896
2 CONT 
2 CONT As the depression worsened, the Pullman Company in 1894 reduced workers' 
2 CONT wages and fired some who objected to the reduction. Workers belonged to 
2 CONT the American Railway Union, and sympathizers blocked the passage of trains 
2 CONT pulling Pullman cars. At the request of company leaders, and despite the 
2 CONT protests of Governor John Peter Altgeld of Illinois, Cleveland sent 
2 CONT federal troops to Chicago to restore order and ensure the passage of mail 
2 CONT trains, thereby upholding federal law. The momentum of the strike was 
2 CONT broken, but so was the Democratic party. Workers, suffering farmers, and 
2 CONT silverites combined in 1896 to nominate Bryan for the presidency. The 
2 CONT Cleveland "gold Democrats" refused to support Bryan, and the Republican 
2 CONT William McKinley was victorious. In 1897, Cleveland returned with his 
2 CONT family to Princeton, New Jersey, where he pursued private life, 
2 CONT occasionally giving lectures at universities.
2 CONT   
2 CONT Cleveland's political rise was due largely to factionalism in national 
2 CONT politics; but he is remembered for his desire to protect the public trust 
2 CONT and to assert the power of the presidency.

1 NOTE He was the first president to exploit the public dimensions of his office 
2 CONT in an age of mass communications, a reform leader at home and a skilled 
2 CONT diplomat abroad. In his lifetime Roosevelt became a personal model, 
2 CONT particularly for the country's youth, in a way that no public figure has 
2 CONT matched. He was one of the most popular presidents in American history. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He was educated by private tutors and studied at Harvard University, 
2 CONT graduating in 1880 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the most prestigious 
2 CONT social clubs. Ill health marred his boyhood, and he suffered poor 
2 CONT eyesight, attacks of asthma, and nervous digestion, before teenage 
2 CONT body-building efforts transformed him into a strong, vigorous young man. 
2 CONT After his father's sudden death in 1878, Roosevelt forsook scientific 
2 CONT ambitions, developed political interests. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Political Career
2 CONT     
2 CONT After graduation from college, Roosevelt entered politics and abandoned 
2 CONT the study of law when, as a Republican, he was elected to the New York 
2 CONT State Assembly in 1881. He attracted immediate attention in the press with 
2 CONT his upper-class background, colorful personality, and bold independence. 
2 CONT In 1884, after serving three years in the Assembly, he left politics 
2 CONT briefly, both from grief at the death of his wife and because he had 
2 CONT alienated the reform wing of his party that year by supporting James G. 
2 CONT Blaine for the presidency. Roosevelt spent the next two years ranching and 
2 CONT hunting in the Dakota Territory, which began his identification with the 
2 CONT Wild West. He continued to write histories, biographies, and magazine 
2 CONT articles, producing more than a dozen books between 1880 and 1900. Back in 
2 CONT politics in 1886, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York City, 
2 CONT campaigned for the national Republican ticket in 1888, and served as Civil 
2 CONT Service commissioner in Washington, D.C., from 1889 to 1895. From 1895 to 
2 CONT 1897, Roosevelt renewed political ties and enhanced his fame with his 
2 CONT energetic, reform-minded service as New York City's police commissioner. 
2 CONT After campaigning for his party's national ticket again in 1896, he became 
2 CONT assistant secretary of the navy and worked to expand and modernize the 
2 CONT navy and get the United States into war with Spain over Cuba. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT War Hero and Vice-President
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Spanish-American War made Roosevelt a nationally known figure. His 
2 CONT volunteer cavalry regiment, which included both cowboys and aristocrats 
2 CONT like himself, was dubbed the Rough Riders and received extensive press 
2 CONT coverage. Their charge at the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba (July 1898) 
2 CONT was the most celebrated exploit of the war. Roosevelt became a popular 
2 CONT hero overnight, and his favorite nickname for the rest of his life was the 
2 CONT Colonel. He reaped a swift political reward when his party's New York 
2 CONT boss, Senator Thomas C. Platt (1833-1910), chose him to run for governor 
2 CONT in the face of scandals that threatened a Republican defeat. Enormous 
2 CONT crowds greeted the candidate wherever he appeared in the 1898 campaign, 
2 CONT and he carried his ticket to a narrow victory. Those crowds and similar 
2 CONT outpourings when Roosevelt traveled west to a Rough Riders' reunion in 
2 CONT 1899 propelled him toward the Republican vice-presidential nomination as 
2 CONT William McKinley's running mate in 1900. Also favoring his nomination was 
2 CONT Senator Platt's desire to get him out of New York. Roosevelt was an 
2 CONT activist, independent governor, who did not submit to the Republican 
2 CONT organization; he responded to popular disquiet over big business and 
2 CONT showed his own concern over conservation of natural resources. Gracefully 
2 CONT although unwillingly submitting to the vice-presidential draft, Roosevelt 
2 CONT demonstrated his energy and popularity again in the 1900 campaign, as he 
2 CONT made whirlwind tours appealing to patriotic memories of the war. He had 
2 CONT little to do as vice-president, but his inactivity ended with McKinley's 
2 CONT assassination in September 1901, when Roosevelt became the youngest 
2 CONT president in U.S. history. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Domestic Policy
2 CONT 
2 CONT Roosevelt's entry into the White House changed politics more in mood than 
2 CONT in substance. With his vivid personality, ceaseless activity, young 
2 CONT family, and social glamour, he became a popular idol, a position he 
2 CONT cultivated by careful attention to the press and a flair for the dramatic. 
2 CONT On domestic issues he moved cautiously, probably going little further in 
2 CONT his first term than McKinley would have done. Well-publicized prosecutions 
2 CONT of big businesses earned him acclaim as a trustbuster, and his public 
2 CONT mediation of the anthracite coal strike in 1902 showed sympathies for 
2 CONT labor and consumers. One issue on which he did move boldly was 
2 CONT conservation, both by publicizing it long before any other leader and by 
2 CONT using his presidential powers, often high-handedly, to set aside 125 
2 CONT million acres (about 51 million ha) of western land as national forests. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Roosevelt went further after his triumphant election in 1904. Having 
2 CONT consolidated his position among Republicans, he won the nomination without 
2 CONT opposition and ran on his record, which he called the Square Deal, to win 
2 CONT a big victory over his colorless Democratic opponent, Alton B. Parker 
2 CONT (1852-1926). Roosevelt's second term brought two legislative milestones:  
2 CONT passage of the Hepburn Railway Rate Act of 1905, which strengthened the 
2 CONT powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Pure Food and Drug 
2 CONT Act of 1906, which established the Food and Drug Administration. He later 
2 CONT advocated further measures to deal with big business and social problems, 
2 CONT but conservative opponents in his own party blocked those proposals. 
2 CONT Roosevelt wielded his political power at home for the last time in 1908 by 
2 CONT picking his friend, Secretary of War William Howard Taft, as his 
2 CONT successor, engineering Taft's nomination and aiding his election to the 
2 CONT presidency. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Foreign Policy
2 CONT 
2 CONT Roosevelt pursued an activist foreign policy from the beginning of his 
2 CONT presidency, in keeping with his longtime motto "Speak softly and carry a 
2 CONT big stick." Sometimes he moved quietly and delicately behind the scenes, 
2 CONT as when he fended off possible German intervention in Venezuela in 1902 
2 CONT and when he worked to preserve the European balance of power in a series 
2 CONT of crises between 1904 and 1906. At other times he acted loudly and 
2 CONT bluntly, as when he abetted the 1903 revolution in Panama that led to 
2 CONT United States acquisition of territory for the Panama Canal, and when he 
2 CONT proclaimed that the United States had "police power" over Latin America in 
2 CONT the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine (1904). He used both public 
2 CONT and private channels in his mediation of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 
2 CONT which won him the Nobel Peace Prize, the first to go to an American and 
2 CONT when he sent a delegation to the Algeciras Conference of 1906 to help 
2 CONT settle a conflict between Germany and France over the control of Morocco. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Throughout his presidency Roosevelt labored to strengthen and modernize 
2 CONT the armed forces. His secretaries of war, Elihu Root and Taft, introduced 
2 CONT the general staff system to the army and streamlined reserve methods. The 
2 CONT navy remained a special concern with Roosevelt, and he harried Congress, 
2 CONT with partial success, to build more battleships and cruisers. In 1907 he 
2 CONT sent America's battle fleet on a voyage around the world, both to impress 
2 CONT Japan during a controversy over exclusion of Oriental immigrants and to 
2 CONT display the nation's new naval prowess. At the same time, he dispatched 
2 CONT Taft to negotiate agreements that appeased Japanese interests in Manchuria 
2 CONT and helped defuse the dispute over immigration. Roosevelt left a record of 
2 CONT strong diplomacy usually tempered by sensitivity and restraint, and he 
2 CONT made his last public appearance as president in February 1909, when he 
2 CONT reviewed the fleet returning from its world cruise. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Third Party Leader
2 CONT 
2 CONT Stepping down from office at the age of 50, younger than most other 
2 CONT presidents have been when first elected, Roosevelt went abroad for more 
2 CONT than a year, first on a hunting and nature-study safari to Africa and then 
2 CONT on a spectacular tour of the European capitals. On his return home in the 
2 CONT summer of 1910 he quickly became embroiled in factional fights among 
2 CONT Republicans and slowly but steadily became estranged from his successor. 
2 CONT Roosevelt finally broke with Taft both because he could not abide the new 
2 CONT president's inept handling of the split between progressive and 
2 CONT conservative Republicans and because he resented his own loss of power. 
2 CONT Assuming command of the progressives and advocating farther-reaching 
2 CONT economic and social reforms, Roosevelt contested the 1912 Republican 
2 CONT presidential nomination, winning most of the primaries but losing at the 
2 CONT convention to the same presidential party control he had earlier used to 
2 CONT nominate Taft. Charging that he had been cheated of the nomination, 
2 CONT Roosevelt bolted to run as the candidate of the hastily formed Progressive 
2 CONT party. When he was wounded in an assassination attempt in Milwaukee, 
2 CONT Wisconsin (October 1912), he made light of it, saying, "It takes more than 
2 CONT that to kill a bull moose." Thereafter, the Progressives were nicknamed 
2 CONT the Bull Moose party. Roosevelt outpolled Taft "a tribute to his abiding 
2 CONT popularity" but his hopes of winning and establishing a new major party 
2 CONT were thwarted. The Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson, who also appealed 
2 CONT to progressives, carried the election. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT World War I
2 CONT 
2 CONT After his 1912 defeat, Roosevelt spent the last six years of his life in 
2 CONT mounting frustration, first over Wilson's enactment of much of his reform 
2 CONT program, then over American neutrality after the outbreak of World War I 
2 CONT in 1914, and finally over his own failure to be allowed to raise a 
2 CONT division to fight in France after the United States entered the war in 
2 CONT 1917. Although he continued to advocate domestic reforms, he increasingly 
2 CONT devoted himself to calling for a strong pro-Allied foreign policy and 
2 CONT greater military preparedness. Roosevelt was gradually reconciled with his 
2 CONT former party opponents, including Taft. He disbanded the Progressives in 
2 CONT 1916 to back the Republican nominee against Wilson, and it seemed certain 
2 CONT that he would be the party's candidate in 1920. His four sons all fought 
2 CONT in World War I, and the death of the youngest, Quentin, in combat as an 
2 CONT aviator in August 1918, was a heavy blow. Roosevelt's health deteriorated 
2 CONT during the final years of his life, partly as a result of tropical fevers 
2 CONT contracted on an expedition to the Amazon region of Brazil in 1914.

1 NOTE He was also 10th chief justice of the U.S. (1921-30); he was the only 
2 CONT person in U.S. history to head two branches of the federal government. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The son of a leading Ohio lawyer and politician, he studied at Yale 
2 CONT University, graduating second in his class in 1878, and at the Cincinnati 
2 CONT Law School, receiving his degree and commencing practice in 1880. Taft 
2 CONT moved rapidly up through appointive offices, as assistant district 
2 CONT attorney and internal revenue collector in Cincinnati in the early 1880s, 
2 CONT later as a state judge, then as solicitor general of the U.S. (1890-92) 
2 CONT and judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals (1892-1900). He was an able 
2 CONT lawyer and a jurist of moderately progressive social views, and he formed 
2 CONT political connections and lasting friendships, the most important of which 
2 CONT were with the future presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. 
2 CONT His wife became his astute adviser and prodded him to pursue lofty 
2 CONT ambitions. Their three children all distinguished themselves.
2 CONT     
2 CONT Rise to Prominence
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1900 President McKinley appointed Taft head of the commission to govern 
2 CONT the Philippines, and the following year he became the islands' first 
2 CONT civilian governor, a post he filled admirably, setting up judicial and 
2 CONT local government systems, starting social services, and dealing with 
2 CONT native leaders and Roman Catholic church officials over land disposition. 
2 CONT His work drew favorable attention from the U.S. press and made him a 
2 CONT popular national figure. In 1904 President Roosevelt named him secretary 
2 CONT of war, a position from which he continued to supervise the Philippines, 
2 CONT directed construction of the Panama Canal and started government in the 
2 CONT Canal Zone, and contributed to the modernization of the army. Taft also 
2 CONT helped to conduct the negotiations that ended the Russo-Japanese War in 
2 CONT 1905, and he traveled to the Far East to settle a conflict with Japan over 
2 CONT the exclusion of Oriental immigration. Twice he declined Roosevelt's 
2 CONT offers of a seat on the Supreme Court, which he wanted, because his wife 
2 CONT persuaded him to remain available for the presidency. Receiving 
2 CONT Roosevelt's nod for the 1908 Republican nomination, he capitalized on the 
2 CONT incumbent's winning popularity and the party's strength, easily defeating 
2 CONT the Democratic nominee, William Jennings Bryan. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Taft as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Taft was not a successful president, both because he faced a difficult 
2 CONT situation and because he lacked political gifts. A deepening division 
2 CONT within the Republican party between progressives and conservatives, which 
2 CONT Roosevelt had smoothed over and evaded, dogged his administration from the 
2 CONT outset. Taft's attempt in 1909 to revise the protective tariff, which had 
2 CONT grown increasingly unpopular, became a fiasco when conservative Republican 
2 CONT senators subverted the legislation. Taft, however, failed either to work 
2 CONT out compromises or to fight for his program, and he alienated his former 
2 CONT progressive supporters. Relations with progressives deteriorated further 
2 CONT in 1910, when, after a complicated administrative struggle, Taft fired the 
2 CONT chief of the Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot, the nation's leading 
2 CONT conservationist and a friend of Roosevelt. Republican unity collapsed in 
2 CONT the 1910 primaries when Taft unsuccessfully opposed several progressives 
2 CONT supported by Roosevelt, and they and the Democrats scored big victories in 
2 CONT the fall elections. Those conflicts doomed the Taft administration 
2 CONT politically, although it did compile a number of accomplishments, 
2 CONT including establishment of the Federal Children's Bureau, vigorous 
2 CONT antitrust prosecutions of big business, and a restrained, pacific foreign 
2 CONT policy. Taft suffered a severe personal and political blow early in his 
2 CONT term when his wife was partially incapacitated by a stroke (1909). 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Taft's presidency might have ended quietly if Roosevelt had not run 
2 CONT against him in 1912. Siding with progressive dissidents, Roosevelt won 
2 CONT most of the primaries but lost the Republican nomination because Taft 
2 CONT controlled the party machinery. Charging a steal, Roosevelt then bolted to 
2 CONT head the third-party Progressive (Bull Moose) ticket. By this time, Taft 
2 CONT regarded Roosevelt as a dangerous demagogue, especially because of his 
2 CONT criticism of court decisions, and he stayed in the presidential race 
2 CONT without hope of winning, only to keep Roosevelt from being elected. 
2 CONT Although he finished behind Roosevelt, carrying only Utah and Vermont, 
2 CONT Taft split the usual Republican vote and threw the election to the 
2 CONT Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson. He was pleased at the outcome and left 
2 CONT the White House with undisguised relief. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Later Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT Taft's years as ex-president were among his happiest and most productive. 
2 CONT In 1913 he became a professor at Yale Law School and finally succeeded in 
2 CONT reducing his renowned weight below 300 lb. He remained active in the 
2 CONT Republican party, and although he criticized Wilson's domestic policies 
2 CONT from an increasingly conservative stance, he supported his successor's 
2 CONT foreign policies and in 1915 headed the League to Enforce Peace, which 
2 CONT advocated a league of nations before Wilson did. After the United States 
2 CONT entered World War I in 1917, Wilson appointed Taft cochairman of the 
2 CONT National War Labor Board, and when the Republicans regained the White 
2 CONT House in 1921, President Warren G. Harding named him chief justice of the 
2 CONT U.S., fulfilling Taft's long-held dream. Taft became one of the great 
2 CONT chief justices in the history of the Supreme Court. He again showed his 
2 CONT administrative ability by reducing the Court's backlog and securing 
2 CONT passage of the Judiciary Act of 1925, which gave the justices more control 
2 CONT over the selection of cases to be heard. Taft also impressed his judicial 
2 CONT views on the Supreme Court, forsaking his own earlier progressivism for a 
2 CONT more conservative stress on property rights and governmental limitation. A 
2 CONT majority of the justices retained his viewpoint until the late 1930s. In 
2 CONT February 1930, Taft resigned the chief justiceship in failing health, and 
2 CONT he died on March 8, 1930.

1 NOTE He was a United States senator, who led conservative Republican opposition

2 CONT and Harry Truman. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He was educated at Yale and Harvard universities. He began practicing law 
2 CONT in Cincinnati in 1913. In 1917-18 Taft was an assistant counsel of the 
2 CONT U.S. Food Administration and in 1919 was a member of the American Relief 
2 CONT Administration, which organized relief for stricken survivors of World War 
2 CONT I in a number of European countries. He was a Republican member of the 
2 CONT Ohio House of Representatives from 1921 to 1926, serving as Speaker of the 
2 CONT House in 1926. In 1931-32 he was a member of the Ohio Senate, and from 
2 CONT 1939 until his death he served in the U.S. Senate. In the Senate Taft 
2 CONT exercised considerable influence in the shaping of Republican party policy 
2 CONT on domestic issues. In 1947 he was the coauthor with New Jersey 
2 CONT Representative Fred Allan Hartley, Jr. (1902-69), of the Labor-Management 
2 CONT Relations Act, popularly known as the Taft-Hartley Law. The act amended 
2 CONT the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and imposed certain restrictions 
2 CONT on the power of labor unions. Among other provisions, it prohibited the 
2 CONT use of the closed-shop agreement. As a conservative Republican leader, he 
2 CONT unsuccessfully campaigned for the presidential nomination of his party in 
2 CONT 1940, 1948, and 1952.  He was the author of A Foreign Policy for Americans 
2 CONT (1951).

1 NOTE He served during relatively prosperous and peaceful years. In a rapidly 
2 CONT changing society, he expressed traditional small-town values. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT Coolidge attended Amherst College (B.A., 1895), studied law, and was 
2 CONT admitted to the bar.  Coolidge began to practice law in Northampton, 
2 CONT Massachusetts, where he was regularly elected to local office until he 
2 CONT became lieutenant governor (1916-18) and governor (1919-20). Brought to 
2 CONT national attention by his suppression of a police strike in Boston -- with 
2 CONT the assertion that "there is no right to strike against the public safety 
2 CONT by anybody, anytime, anywhere" -- Coolidge was chosen by the Republican 
2 CONT National Convention as the party's nominee for vice-president in 1920, on 
2 CONT a ticket headed by Warren G. Harding. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Elected with Harding in a landslide, Coolidge succeeded to the presidency 
2 CONT upon Harding's death in 1923. Having been personally untainted by the 
2 CONT scandals that arose within the Harding administration, he was free to 
2 CONT force the resignation of Harding's attorney general, Harry Daugherty 
2 CONT (1860-1941), and otherwise institute needed reforms. Nominated for 
2 CONT president in his own right in 1924, Coolidge won easily. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Domestic Policies
2 CONT 
2 CONT Coolidge's conception of presidential leadership differed sharply from the 
2 CONT activism of other 20th-century U.S. presidents. Endorsing the Jeffersonian 
2 CONT tradition of minimal government, he believed in waiting for problems to 
2 CONT arise before trying to solve them. Within these narrow limits, he was a 
2 CONT competent and effective leader. He used the presidential press conference 
2 CONT with skill, securing favorable treatment of his administration by the 
2 CONT media of his day. Popularly known as Silent Cal, because of his refusal to 
2 CONT engage in small talk, he could, when he chose, be a voluble and articulate 
2 CONT speaker and writer. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Coolidge believed that "the business of America is business," and that the 
2 CONT business of government was to balance the budget, reduce the debt, cut 
2 CONT taxes, make easy credit available (by means of the Federal Reserve), and 
2 CONT otherwise not interfere with the private enterprise system. Ironically, 
2 CONT the money saved by government thrift flowed to the financial centers in 
2 CONT New York City instead of to Washington. Thus, as the national public debt 
2 CONT diminished, private and municipal debt expanded alarmingly with the 
2 CONT increase in money supply. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Foreign Policy
2 CONT 
2 CONT In foreign policy Coolidge cautiously endorsed America's entry into the 
2 CONT World Court, which the Senate rejected. He was adamant about the repayment 
2 CONT to the U.S. of debts incurred by the Allies in World War I, although he 
2 CONT was relatively flexible about the schedules of repayment. Under Coolidge, 
2 CONT the interventionist Latin American policy of previous presidents was 
2 CONT moderated. Dwight Morrow (1873-1931), his ambassador to Mexico, averted a 
2 CONT serious crisis with that country arising from Mexico's constitutional 
2 CONT decision in 1917 to nationalize its oil industry, in which the U.S. had 
2 CONT substantial investments. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Last Years
2 CONT 
2 CONT Announcing simply that he did "not choose to run" for reelection in 1928, 
2 CONT Coolidge retired to private life in 1929. Consequently he did not have to 
2 CONT deal with the subsequent stock market crash and the depression of the 
2 CONT 1930s, which occurred after he left office.

1 NOTE He held office during the early part of the Great Depression and presided 
2 CONT over the transition from a business-managed economy to the government 
2 CONT intervention of the New Deal. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT His parents and most of his close relatives were rural Quakers, an 
2 CONT influence that was decisive and lifelong. Entering Stanford University 
2 CONT with that institution's first freshman class, Hoover studied geology and 
2 CONT mining. There he met Lou Henry, then the only woman geology major 
2 CONT attending Stanford, who later became his wife. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Managing and reorganizing mining properties in Western Australia and China 
2 CONT (where he and Mrs. Hoover endured the siege of Tientsin during the Boxer 
2 CONT Rebellion) and elsewhere, Hoover was a millionaire by the time he was 40 
2 CONT years old. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Relief Work
2 CONT 
2 CONT At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Hoover organized and assisted the 
2 CONT return of thousands of Americans stranded in Europe and then turned to the 
2 CONT aid of war-torn Belgium. Overcoming resistance from the warring powers, 
2 CONT Hoover's Commission for the Relief of Belgium during the next five years 
2 CONT spent $1 billion in government loans and private donations, operated its 
2 CONT own fleet of 200 ships, and transported 5 million metric tons of food. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Returning home after the U.S. entry into the war in 1917, Hoover headed 
2 CONT the Food Administration, which sought by voluntary methods to curb wartime 
2 CONT profiteering in food supplies. After the war an American Relief 
2 CONT Administration under Hoover's leadership distributed food, clothing, and 
2 CONT medical supplies to refugees in Eastern Europe, including the Soviet 
2 CONT Union, although Hoover personally detested communism. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Secretary of Commerce
2 CONT 
2 CONT Hoover's reputation as engineer and humanitarian projected him onto the 
2 CONT political stage. Mentioned as a presidential possibility as early as 1920, 
2 CONT he served (1921-28) as secretary of commerce under Presidents Warren G. 
2 CONT Harding and Calvin Coolidge. Believing neither in traditional 
2 CONT laissez-faire nor in economic planning and direction by the state, Hoover 
2 CONT preached a doctrine of voluntary cooperation by privately associated 
2 CONT Americans with the support, but not the control, of government. His 
2 CONT management of flood relief on the Mississippi in 1927 showed this 
2 CONT philosophy in action. He did, however, sponsor the expansion of government 
2 CONT regulation in two areas of new technology, radiobroadcasting and 
2 CONT commercial aviation. He made federally collected statistics more usefully 
2 CONT available and encouraged manufacturers to standardize parts and supplies. 
2 CONT Hoover saw the Department of Commerce as an important support for the 
2 CONT expansion of American business overseas, and in the area of foreign 
2 CONT commerce the department expanded its operations tremendouslyat the 
2 CONT expense, some felt, of the State Department's traditional role. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Hoover as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Nominated for president by the Republicans in 1928, Hoover defeated 
2 CONT Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, the Democratic candidate, in a 
2 CONT campaign marred by partisan use of the issue of religion (Smith was a 
2 CONT Roman Catholic), a controversy in which Hoover, to his credit, did not 
2 CONT participate. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Depression
2 CONT 
2 CONT Inaugurated in March 1929, Hoover enjoyed only a half year of the economic 
2 CONT prosperity with which the country had become familiar during the 1920s. In 
2 CONT the fall, after the stock market had crashed, he took unprecedented 
2 CONT measures to deal with the depression that followed. In the interest of 
2 CONT maintaining consumer purchasing power, he urged business leaders not to 
2 CONT cut wages, as had been their usual custom during hard times. The policy 
2 CONT was only temporarily successful; production declined, unemployment grew, 
2 CONT and eventually wages for those still employed were cut after all. In 
2 CONT addition, the government's own policies, leading to a drastic decline in 
2 CONT the money supply, may have hastened the slide into the depression. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Hoover sanctioned increasing government expenditure for useful public 
2 CONT works, and after some prodding, government loans to business firms through 
2 CONT a Reconstruction Finance Corporation. As the economy continued in 
2 CONT stagnation, however, private and local relief funds became exhausted; 
2 CONT against his own voluntaristic principles, therefore, Hoover reluctantly 
2 CONT turned to direct federal spending for welfare purposes. Politically, it 
2 CONT was too late; Hoover's Democratic opponents had fashioned an image of him 
2 CONT as a reactionary unwilling to do anything to help people in distress. 
2 CONT Unfair though it was, in light of Hoover's previous record, this 
2 CONT stereotype haunted him, and his party, for the rest of his life, even 
2 CONT though his opponents, when they came to power in 1933, wrestled with the 
2 CONT same intractable problems until wartime production and employment came to 
2 CONT their rescue. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Hoover believed that the causes of the Great Depression were international 
2 CONT and that the remedy for it must be sought in the same fashion. He 
2 CONT therefore sponsored (1931) a moratorium on interallied war debts. He was 
2 CONT planning an international monetary conference in London when his defeat 
2 CONT for reelection intervened. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Foreign Affairs
2 CONT 
2 CONT Hoover's foreign policy was also based on voluntary cooperation. His 
2 CONT overtures to Latin America, in contrast to the traditional U.S. 
2 CONT imperialism in that area, foreshadowed the good neighbor policy of 
2 CONT Franklin D. Roosevelt and his secretary of state, Cordell Hull. He opposed 
2 CONT retaliation against Japan for its invasion of Manchuria (1931), rejecting 
2 CONT the idea that the U.S. had a responsibility to police the world. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Later Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT Nominated for reelection in 1932, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. 
2 CONT Roosevelt. He wrote and spoke against Roosevelt's New Deal, but little 
2 CONT attention was paid to him except at Republican national conventions, where 
2 CONT he ritually appeared every four years to be hailed as an elder statesman. 
2 CONT Under Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, however, he headed 
2 CONT two groups (known as the Hoover Commissions) that planned an extensive 
2 CONT reorganization of the executive branch of the government. Hoover's books 
2 CONT include American Individualism (1922), The Challenge to Liberty (1934), 
2 CONT and Memoirs (3 vol., 1951-52).

1 NOTE Roosevelt was elected for an unprecedented four terms, he was one of the 
2 CONT 20th century's most skillful political leaders. His New Deal program, a 
2 CONT response to the Great Depression, utilized the federal government as an 
2 CONT instrument of social and economic change in contrast to its traditionally 
2 CONT passive role. Then, in World War II, he led the Allies in their defeat of 
2 CONT the Axis powers. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Early Life
2 CONT         
2 CONT His father, a semiretired railway executive, was a cousin of Theodore 
2 CONT Roosevelt, the 26th president of the U.S. Although they were not wealthy 
2 CONT by late 19th-century standards, the Roosevelts of Hyde Park led a 
2 CONT comfortable, gracious existence, and young Franklin's life was sheltered; 
2 CONT he was educated by governesses and indulged by his father. A handsome 
2 CONT youth, he was an excellent athlete, expert at boating and swimming, and he 
2 CONT also collected stamps, birds, and ship models -- hobbies that he pursued 
2 CONT all his life. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT His formal education began at the Groton School in Massachusetts, where 
2 CONT the headmaster, Endicott Peabody (1857-1944), stressed to his wealthy 
2 CONT young students their obligation toward those who were less fortunate in 
2 CONT society. After graduation from Harvard University in 1904, Roosevelt 
2 CONT attended Columbia University Law School without taking a degree and was 
2 CONT admitted to the New York State bar in 1907. Despite his widowed mother's 
2 CONT objections, he married a distant cousin, in a gala society wedding at 
2 CONT which President Theodore Roosevelt gave the bride away. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Beginning of Roosevelt's Political Career
2 CONT 
2 CONT Franklin Roosevelt's political career began with his election to the New 
2 CONT York State Senate as a Democrat in 1910. He quickly gained the national 
2 CONT limelight as the leader of an upstate coalition that fought the influence 
2 CONT of New York City's Democratic machine. His support of Woodrow Wilson's 
2 CONT candidacy as the Democratic presidential nominee in 1912 resulted in his 
2 CONT appointment to the post of assistant secretary of the navy, which he held 
2 CONT during World War I. James M. Cox of Ohio, the party's 1920 nominee for the 
2 CONT presidency, chose Roosevelt as his running mate because of his family 
2 CONT name, but the Cox-Roosevelt ticket proved to be no match for the 
2 CONT Republicans under Warren G. Harding. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Roosevelt faced the greatest personal crisis of his life when he was 
2 CONT stricken by poliomyelitis at his Canadian summer home on Campobello 
2 CONT Island, New Brunswick, in 1921. He veiled his deep physical agony with a 
2 CONT cheerful demeanor and rejected his mother's advice that he abandon 
2 CONT politics and become a country squire at Hyde Park. Encouraged by Eleanor 
2 CONT and his dedicated political mentor, Louis McHenry Howe (1871-1936), he 
2 CONT resumed his career by nominating Alfred E. Smith for the presidency at the 
2 CONT Democratic convention in 1924 and again in 1928, when Smith won the 
2 CONT party's nomination. The Democratic party of the 1920s was deeply divided 
2 CONT between Protestant, rural voters, who favored Prohibition, and urban Roman 
2 CONT Catholics, who opposed it. Anxious to win the New York State electoral 
2 CONT vote, Smith persuaded Roosevelt to campaign for the governorship, given 
2 CONT the latter's strong upstate appeal. Roosevelt, deeply in debt and disabled 
2 CONT by polio, won a narrow victory, while Smith was defeated by Herbert 
2 CONT Hoover. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Governor of New York
2 CONT 
2 CONT During two terms as governor of New York (1928-32), Roosevelt established 
2 CONT a reputation as a reforming progressive in the Theodore Roosevelt 
2 CONT tradition and as a champion of relief for impoverished upstate farmers. 
2 CONT His greatest struggle -- for control of the Saint Lawrence River 
2 CONT waterpower resource by the state rather than private utilities -- aimed at 
2 CONT providing cheaper electricity for the rural consumer. With the outbreak of 
2 CONT the Great Depression, he identified himself with the urban relief cause by 
2 CONT appointing Harry Hopkins to head the Temporary Emergency Relief 
2 CONT Administration. As the depression deepened, he assembled the "Brains 
2 CONT Trust," a group of faculty members from Columbia University, to formulate 
2 CONT with him a comprehensive program for resolving the economic collapse that 
2 CONT had begun in 1929. With the aid of a progressive-southern Democratic 
2 CONT coalition in 1932, Roosevelt won the party's presidential nomination, then 
2 CONT easily defeated Hoover in the national election. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Roosevelt as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Roosevelt's promise of "a new deal for the American people" foreshadowed a 
2 CONT revolutionary extension of federal power into the nation's everyday life. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Effort to Restore Prosperity
2 CONT     
2 CONT His first three months in office, known as the Hundred Days, were marked 
2 CONT by innovative legislation originating in the executive branch. In a period 
2 CONT of massive unemployment (25 percent of the work force), a collapsed stock 
2 CONT market, thousands of bank closings for lack of liquidity, and agricultural 
2 CONT prices that had fallen below the cost of production, Congress, at 
2 CONT Roosevelt's request, passed a series of emergency measures calculated to 
2 CONT provide liquidity for banking institutions and relief for the individual 
2 CONT and to prevent business bankruptcy. Further, abandonment of the gold 
2 CONT standard in 1933 had the effect of devaluating the dollar in international 
2 CONT markets. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In addition to relief measures, such as creation of the Works Progress 
2 CONT Administration under the direction of Harry Hopkins, the New Deal aimed at 
2 CONT long-range economic solutions to problems stemming from World War I. The 
2 CONT farm depression, a result of overproduction, had begun in 1921 and sent 
2 CONT millions to the cities during the 1920s; Roosevelt regarded it as the root 
2 CONT cause of the economic collapse of the late 1920s. He responded with a 
2 CONT broad agricultural program framed by the Agricultural Adjustment Acts of 
2 CONT 1933 and 1938. This legislation introduced production controls for certain 
2 CONT basic commodities, including corn, cotton, wheat, tobacco, and hogs, in 
2 CONT order to create a balance between supply and demand; it promoted 
2 CONT reforestation and conservation and provided subsidy payments for curtailed 
2 CONT planting; and it utilized the concept of an ever-normal granary, balancing 
2 CONT crop surplus against lean years. Creation of the Tennessee Valley 
2 CONT Authority in 1933 benefited one of the nation's most impoverished areas. 
2 CONT This multipurpose development included federal construction of dams to 
2 CONT harness cheap hydroelectric power, water management, improvement of 
2 CONT farming techniques and river navigation, and the construction of hospitals 
2 CONT and schools. New industries attracted by cheap electricity and labor 
2 CONT diversified the southern economy. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The New Deal Coalition
2 CONT     
2 CONT Although Roosevelt's ties to the city and organized labor were never 
2 CONT strong, many New Deal measures alienated the business community at the 
2 CONT same time they attracted the urban minorities and the labor movement into 
2 CONT the orbit of the Democratic party. The National Industrial Recovery Act 
2 CONT (NIRA, 1933) began as an industrial stabilization scheme designed to 
2 CONT eliminate cutthroat practices and maintain prices. Section 7a of the law, 
2 CONT which promoted labor unionization, alienated conservative businesspeople, 
2 CONT however. Strict securities-issuance and stock exchange regulation, 
2 CONT enforced by a newly created Securities and Exchange Commission, 
2 CONT intensified business opposition. Benefits provided by the Social Security 
2 CONT Act, by unemployment insurance legislation, and by the Fair Labor 
2 CONT Standards Act of 1938 attracted workers' support. In 1935 and 1936 the 
2 CONT traditional-minded U.S. Supreme Court struck at key New Deal measures by 
2 CONT declaring provisions of both the NIRA and the Agricultural Adjustment Act 
2 CONT unconstitutional. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Second Term
2 CONT 
2 CONT After winning a resounding victory over Alfred M. Landon in the 1936 
2 CONT presidential election, Roosevelt tried to neutralize the Court by 
2 CONT proposing the appointment of new justices, but Congress rejected this 
2 CONT "court-packing" plan in 1937. In the ensuing years a congressional 
2 CONT coalition of conservative Republicans and Democrats, fearful of growing 
2 CONT federal spending in the 1937-38 depression and anxious to curtail 
2 CONT expansion of federal power into areas traditionally reserved to the 
2 CONT states, checked the New Deal's momentum. The imminence of war in Europe, 
2 CONT followed by U.S. involvement, drew attention away from the president's 
2 CONT domestic defeats and made possible his victories over Republican 
2 CONT candidates Wendell L. Willkie in 1940 and Thomas E. Dewey in 1944. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Prewar Foreign Policy
2 CONT     
2 CONT Roosevelt was a pragmatist in his diplomatic views in the interwar period. 
2 CONT Although he had been a supporter of Woodrow Wilson, he abandoned Wilson's 
2 CONT internationalist ideas when the country turned to isolationism in the 
2 CONT 1920s. Then, in the late 1930s, spurred by Adolf Hitler's aggression in 
2 CONT Europe and Japanese expansionism in the Pacific, Roosevelt moved the 
2 CONT United States back toward engagement in world affairs. He was restrained, 
2 CONT however, by the persistence of strong isolationist sentiment among the 
2 CONT voters and by congressional passage of a series of neutrality laws 
2 CONT intended to prevent American involvement in a second world war. Roosevelt 
2 CONT won the contest when, alarmed by Germany's defeat of France in 1940, 
2 CONT Congress passed his lend-lease legislation to help Great Britain's 
2 CONT continued resistance to the Germans. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 
2 CONT on December 7, 1941, brought the United States into the worldwide contest 
2 CONT on the side of Britain and the Soviet Union. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT World War II
2 CONT     
2 CONT Roosevelt framed his diplomatic objectives as wartime leader in a series 
2 CONT of wartime conferences. In collaboration with Winston Churchill he 
2 CONT explained Anglo-American war aims in August 1941 in the form of the 
2 CONT Atlantic Charter. It denied territorial ambitions, favored self-government 
2 CONT and liberal international trade arrangements, and pledged freedom from 
2 CONT want and permanent security against aggression. At Casablanca, Morocco, in 
2 CONT January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill insisted on Germany's unconditional 
2 CONT surrender as a means of preventing the enemy's future military resurgence. 
2 CONT The Québec Conference (August 1943) planned the Normandy invasion. At 
2 CONT Moscow (October 1943) the Allied foreign ministers approved in principle a 
2 CONT postwar organization for world security. Military strategy and the problem 
2 CONT of postwar Germany came under discussion at Cairo (November-December 1943) 
2 CONT and Québec (September 1944). Finally, at Yalta in the USSR (February 
2 CONT 1945), Roosevelt, Churchill, and Joseph Stalin broached their plans for a 
2 CONT postwar world. In the process, Roosevelt pressed for admission of China to 
2 CONT the Allied councils as a major power, liberalization of international 
2 CONT trade as a means of preventing future wars, and creation of a United 
2 CONT Nations organization as a mechanism for preserving peace. He did not, 
2 CONT however, see the end of the war. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
2 CONT   
2 CONT Roosevelt's vision of a peaceful and stable postwar world foundered on 
2 CONT national ambition. Although he bypassed Churchill and a weakened Great 
2 CONT Britain to deal with Stalin at Yalta, it became apparent on the eve of his 
2 CONT death that Soviet ambitions included the occupation of eastern and central 
2 CONT Europe. His faith in the ability of the UN to keep the peace through the 
2 CONT collaboration of the former wartime Allies proved unworkable in the era of 
2 CONT the cold war.

1 NOTE She was the first lady of the United States, prominent in her own right as 
2 CONT a social activist, author, lecturer, and United States representative to 
2 CONT the United Nations. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT She was a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. Her mother died when she 
2 CONT was eight, her father when she was ten. She then lived with her maternal 
2 CONT grandmother and at the age of 15 was sent to a boarding school in England. 
2 CONT On her return home she did social work in New York before marrying her 
2 CONT distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt. The couple's domestic life was 
2 CONT dominated by Franklin's mother, and Franklin avoided involvement in the 
2 CONT management of their home or the discipline of their five children. 
2 CONT Eleanor's discovery of Franklin's affair with her social secretary, Lucy 
2 CONT Page Mercer (1891-1948), in 1918 was a turning point in their marriage. 
2 CONT Although the affair ended when Franklin refused a divorce, Eleanor 
2 CONT resolved to have a career of her own. Determination became a necessity 
2 CONT when Franklin was stricken with poliomyelitis after his unsuccessful bid 
2 CONT for the vice-presidency in 1920. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Eleanor Roosevelt became active in Democratic party politics in the 1920s 
2 CONT as a means of keeping her handicapped husband's political career alive. 
2 CONT When he was elected to the presidency in 1932, she continued to assist 
2 CONT him, and although she held no office, soon became an influential figure in 
2 CONT his administration. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Great Depression broadened Mrs. Roosevelt's concerns. During the 1930s 
2 CONT she sponsored an experiment at Arthurdale, West Virginia, designed to 
2 CONT bring small-scale manufacturing to impoverished coal miners in a 
2 CONT self-sustaining community. Widespread unemployment, particularly among 
2 CONT youth, led to her support of the New Deal's National Youth Administration, 
2 CONT a program for youth employment, and of the leftist-dominated American 
2 CONT Youth Congress. More liberal than the president, she worked to promote 
2 CONT racial equality, and in a famous incident resigned from the Daughters of 
2 CONT the American Revolution when the black singer Marian Anderson was denied 
2 CONT the use of their facilities. During World War II she visited American 
2 CONT soldiers around the world, championed desegregation of the armed forces, 
2 CONT and at the war's end urged admission to Palestine of Jewish refugees from 
2 CONT Europe. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Following the death of her husband in 1945, Mrs. Roosevelt was a founder 
2 CONT (1947) of the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group within the 
2 CONT Democratic party, and during the 1950s she was a strong supporter of party 
2 CONT leader Adlai Stevenson. As a U.S. delegate to the UN from 1945 to 1953, 
2 CONT she was chairperson of the commission that drafted the Universal 
2 CONT Declaration of Human Rights. Mrs. Roosevelt was the author of "My Day," a 
2 CONT widely read newspaper column, and of numerous books, including "It's Up to 
2 CONT the Women" (1933) and "This I Remember" (1949).

1 NOTE He was the only President to have resigned from office. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Nixon's parents were poor, and his early life was one of hard work and 
2 CONT study. He was a gifted student, finishing second in his class at Whittier 
2 CONT College (1934) in Whittier, California, and third in his class at Duke 
2 CONT University Law School (1937). Unable to find a position with a Wall Street 
2 CONT (New York City) law firm after his graduation, Nixon returned to Whittier 
2 CONT to practice. Nixon enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1942 and served as a 
2 CONT supply officer in the South Pacific during World War II. He left the 
2 CONT service as a lieutenant commander. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Back in Whittier in 1946, Nixon was persuaded by a group of southern 
2 CONT California Republicans to challenge Democratic congressman Jerry Voorhis 
2 CONT (1901-84). Nixon campaigned vigorously, tabbed the liberal Voorhis as a 
2 CONT dangerous left-winger, and won by 16,000 votes. In 1948 and 1949 Nixon 
2 CONT achieved a national reputation in the U.S. House of Representatives as a 
2 CONT member of the Committee on Un-American Activities during its investigation 
2 CONT of what became known as the Hiss case. In 1950 Nixon ran for the U.S. 
2 CONT Senate against Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas (1900-80), whom he 
2 CONT labeled the "Pink Lady" for what he alleged to be her pro-Communist 
2 CONT sympathies. He won the election, but his campaign tactics were widely 
2 CONT criticized. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Vice-President
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1952 the Republicans nominated Nixon to be the running mate of 
2 CONT presidential candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower. When it was disclosed that as 
2 CONT a senator Nixon had accepted an $18,000 fund for "political expenses" from 
2 CONT California businessmen, he was nearly dropped from the Republican ticket. 
2 CONT Nixon's televised self-defense, called the "Checkers" speech because of a 
2 CONT sentimental reference to his dog Checkers, saved his political life. As 
2 CONT vice-president, Nixon emerged as a vigorous Republican spokesman during 
2 CONT the Eisenhower years, campaigning in a cut-and-thrust style that 
2 CONT contrasted with Eisenhower's nonpartisan aloofness. In nonelection years, 
2 CONT Nixon toured the country trying to bolster Republican party finances and 
2 CONT spirit. He also developed foreign affairs credentials by visiting numerous 
2 CONT other countries, including the Soviet Union, where an impromptu "kitchen 
2 CONT debate" with Nikita S. Khrushchev made worldwide headlines in July 1959. 
2 CONT As undisputed party leader at the end of Eisenhower's second term, Nixon 
2 CONT easily won the presidential nomination in 1960. Against the articulate, 
2 CONT wealthy, and politically well-connected John F. Kennedy, however, the 
2 CONT Nixon edge in experience and prominence melted away. Kennedy won with a 
2 CONT narrow popular-vote margin of 113,000 votes out of 68.8 million cast. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Returning to California, Nixon sought to revitalize his political career 
2 CONT by challenging Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown (1905- ) in the 1962 
2 CONT gubernatorial race. Defeated, Nixon angrily announced his withdrawal from 
2 CONT active politics. He moved to New York City and began a lucrative law 
2 CONT practice. He continued, however, to speak out on foreign policy issues, 
2 CONT address Republican fund rallies, and maintain his strong influence in the 
2 CONT party. By 1968 he was poised again to try for the presidency, this time as 
2 CONT a more seasoned and temperate "new Nixon." With Spiro T. Agnew as the 
2 CONT vice-presidential candidate, the Republican campaign made skillful use of 
2 CONT television, benefited from national dissatisfaction with the war in 
2 CONT Vietnam, and profited from factional divisions in the Democratic camp. 
2 CONT Nixon defeated Hubert H. Humphrey with a popular-vote majority of about 
2 CONT 500,000 votes. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT President
2 CONT 
2 CONT At the pinnacle in 1969, President Nixon organized the White House to 
2 CONT protect his energy and time. He left routine matters and most 
2 CONT administrative affairs to such powerful aides as H. R. Haldeman (1926- ), 
2 CONT John Ehrlichman (1925- ) and Charles Colson (1931- ). This allowed him 
2 CONT time for what had become his absorbing interest: international affairs. 
2 CONT With Henry A. Kissinger as his most trusted foreign policy adviser, Nixon 
2 CONT redefined the American role in the world, suggesting limits to U.S. 
2 CONT resources and commitments. "After a period of confrontation," he declared 
2 CONT in his inaugural address, "we are entering an era of negotiation." He 
2 CONT ordered a gradual withdrawal of the 500,000 U.S. troops in South Vietnam. 
2 CONT The withdrawal took four years, however, during which the war raged and 
2 CONT U.S. casualties mounted. Nixon authorized a U.S. incursion into Cambodia 
2 CONT in 1970 and the bombing of Hanoi and the mining of Haiphong Harbor in 
2 CONT 1972. These actions were unpopular, but he credited them with helping to 
2 CONT bring about a negotiated settlement by which all U.S. forces were 
2 CONT withdrawn and all known U.S. prisoners of war released before the end of 
2 CONT March 1973. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Nixon's greatest innovation was his approach to the People's Republic of 
2 CONT China. Sensing that the time was right to make an overture to China, Nixon 
2 CONT sent Kissinger to confer secretly with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai in July 
2 CONT 1971. Nixon's own 1972 summit meeting in China was a diplomatic triumph 
2 CONT that left the president's critics, accustomed to his fervent 
2 CONT anti-Communism, astonished and off-balance. Within a few weeks, Nixon was 
2 CONT in Moscow to negotiate the first step in a strategic arms limitation 
2 CONT agreement. Born in that session was the era of détente, a search for 
2 CONT accommodation between the two superpowers and an effort to reduce the 
2 CONT danger of nuclear war. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Other parts of the world were not neglected. In the strategically vital 
2 CONT Middle East, Nixon established links with Egypt while maintaining the U.S. 
2 CONT commitment to Israel. After the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the United States 
2 CONT replaced the Soviet Union as the dominant influence in Egypt. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT At home, Nixon adopted the so-called New Federalism, a program designed to 
2 CONT end what he said was the Democratic habit of "throwing money at problems." 
2 CONT Congress passed part of the plan -- revenue sharing with states and cities 
2 CONT -- and appropriated some $30 billion for local needs. While espousing the 
2 CONT fiscal conservatism traditional to his party, Nixon held to no set 
2 CONT economic course. After first advocating a balanced budget, he turned to 
2 CONT deficit financing. Having decided against wage and price controls to 
2 CONT battle rising inflation rates, he reversed himself dramatically in August 
2 CONT 1971. He imposed controls, with limited success, in four phases extending 
2 CONT into 1974. Nixon's economic policies were bold but inconsistent, and, 
2 CONT partly because of rapidly rising energy costs, he was unable to avert a 
2 CONT recession in 1974. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT On racial matters, Nixon generally adopted a passive stance toward efforts 
2 CONT by American blacks to achieve educational, economic, and social equality. 
2 CONT He personally opposed busing but insisted that the law be upheld in cases 
2 CONT where the courts required it. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Nixon response to rising urban crime rates included demands for 
2 CONT stricter law enforcement and less "coddling" of criminals and radical 
2 CONT activists. The leading voice for this politically popular theme of "law 
2 CONT and order" was Attorney General John N. Mitchell, the president's former 
2 CONT law partner and campaign manager. Nixon's four Supreme Court appointees, 
2 CONT men whom he called "strict constructionists," brought a more conservative 
2 CONT cast to the Court. They were Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices 
2 CONT Harry Blackmun, Lewis Powell, Jr., and William Rehnquist.

2 CONT Up for reelection in 1972, Nixon was fresh from the Beijing and Moscow 
2 CONT triumphs and enjoying the peak of his popularity. He defeated the 
2 CONT Democratic senator George S. McGovern (1922- ) by one of the largest 
2 CONT majorities in U.S. history. Only one small cloud appeared on the horizon. 
2 CONT The attempted burglary and wiretapping of the Democratic National 
2 CONT Committee headquarters on June 17, 1972, at the Watergate complex had been 
2 CONT traced to men hired by some of the president's closest advisers. Newspaper 
2 CONT reporters took the slender thread found at the Watergate burglary and 
2 CONT followed it to the White House. Through determined reporting, a larger 
2 CONT picture of political corruption was uncovered. Illegal campaign 
2 CONT contributions, political "dirty tricks," and irregularities in Nixon's 
2 CONT income taxes were unearthed as the story grew during 1973. Testimony 
2 CONT before the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, 
2 CONT chaired by Senator Sam Ervin, Jr. (1896-1985), revealed that extensive 
2 CONT tape recordings existed of conversations held in Nixon's office. The 
2 CONT various investigations, including that by Archibald Cox (1912- ), who was 
2 CONT appointed special prosecutor for the case in May 1973, began to focus on 
2 CONT the release of these vital tapes. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Public trust in Nixon's leadership plummeted after he had Cox dismissed in 
2 CONT October 1973. To compound the president's problems, Vice-President Agnew, 
2 CONT facing bribery charges, resigned in the same month. In his choice of a 
2 CONT replacement, Nixon settled on a popular U.S. congressman certain of quick 
2 CONT confirmation: Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, who was sworn in on December 6, 
2 CONT 1973. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT A federal grand jury named the president in March 1974 as an unindicted 
2 CONT coconspirator in a conspiracy to obstruct justice in the Watergate 
2 CONT investigation. Attorney Leon Jaworski (1905-82), who replaced Cox as 
2 CONT special Watergate prosecutor, continued to press for the White House 
2 CONT tapes, while the House Judiciary Committee began to investigate the case 
2 CONT for impeachment. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Nixon tried to reestablish his authority with trips to the Middle East and 
2 CONT the Soviet Union in the summer of 1974. But the Watergate net closed 
2 CONT around him tighter upon his return. On July 24, the Supreme Court 
2 CONT unanimously ruled that the president had to turn over the last tapes. One 
2 CONT of these, recording his order to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 
2 CONT halt its investigation of the Watergate break-in, was conclusive evidence 
2 CONT -- the so-called smoking gun -- of Nixon's primary role in a cover-up. The 
2 CONT Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment to the full House of 
2 CONT Representatives. On the evening of August 8, Nixon went on nationwide 
2 CONT television to announce his decision, unprecedented in U.S. history, to 
2 CONT resign. At noon on August 9, Gerald Ford took the oath of office as Nixon 
2 CONT was being flown to retirement in California. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Pardoned by his successor "for all offenses against the United States 
2 CONT which he... committed or may have committed" in office, Nixon in 
2 CONT retirement kept a low profile but presented his memoirs and foreign policy 
2 CONT insights in TV interviews and in book form.

1 NOTE He was the only president elected neither to the presidency nor to the 
2 CONT vice-presidency. He attempted during his 24-year term to restore the 
2 CONT nation's confidence in a government tarnished by the Watergate scandal. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Ford's original name was Leslie Lynch King, Jr. His parents were divorced, 
2 CONT and his mother moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she married Gerald 
2 CONT R. Ford, who adopted her son and changed his name to Gerald R. Ford, Jr. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Ford entered the University of Michigan in 1931; he played varsity 
2 CONT football on the undefeated 1932 and 1933 teams and was named the most 
2 CONT valuable player in 1934. He attended Yale Law School from 1935 to 1941. 
2 CONT After graduating and practicing law in Grand Rapids for a few months, Ford 
2 CONT enlisted in the navy and saw action in the South Pacific. He was 
2 CONT discharged in 1946. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1948 Ford was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his 
2 CONT tenure there (until 1973), he was a strict conservative, opposing federal 
2 CONT aid to education and housing, increases in the minimum wage, Medicare, the 
2 CONT Office of Economic Opportunity, and antipollution bills. In 1970 he led an 
2 CONT unsuccessful attempt to impeach the liberal Supreme Court Justice William 
2 CONT O. Douglas. Ford favored increasing the defense budget, and he usually 
2 CONT voted for civil rights legislation. In 1965 he was elected minority leader 
2 CONT of the House of Representatives. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The Presidency
2 CONT 
2 CONT Following the resignation of Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew in 1973, Ford 
2 CONT was chosen as his successor by President Richard M. Nixon. During his nine 
2 CONT months as vice-president, Ford staunchly defended Nixon, who was accused 
2 CONT of misconduct in the Watergate affair. When Nixon resigned under threat of 
2 CONT impeachment on August 9, 1974, Ford was sworn in as the new president. One 
2 CONT of his first and most controversial acts was to pardon Nixon for all 
2 CONT federal crimes he might have committed in office. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Domestic Policy
2 CONT 
2 CONT At home, Ford faced three major problems: rising inflation, unemployment, 
2 CONT and energy use. He tried to control inflation by restricting spending for 
2 CONT social programs -- he vetoed more than 50 bills -- and by attempting to 
2 CONT win public support for a campaign known as Whip Inflation Now (WIN). 
2 CONT During his two and a half years in office, the annual inflation rate 
2 CONT dropped from 11.2 to 5.3 percent. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT To attack unemployment, which in early 1975 was near 9 percent (the 
2 CONT highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s), Ford tried to create 
2 CONT jobs by cutting the taxes of upper-income people so that they would buy 
2 CONT more goods. He resisted demands for government-sponsored public works 
2 CONT projects to create jobs. In the energy area, he supported corporate 
2 CONT development of new energy sources with government subsidies. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Foreign Policy
2 CONT 
2 CONT In foreign affairs, Ford and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, 
2 CONT continued the policy of détente with the Soviet Union begun under Nixon. 
2 CONT In 1975, the U.S. signed the Helsinki Agreement, which ratified post-World 
2 CONT War II European borders and supported human rights. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The 1976 Election
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1976 Ford defeated Ronald Reagan for the Republican party presidential 
2 CONT nomination, dropping his vice-president, Nelson Rockefeller, in favor of 
2 CONT Senator Robert Dole (1923- ) of Kansas. Ford and Dole campaigned against 
2 CONT Democratic party nominees Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale, but lost the 
2 CONT election by a margin of 241 electoral votes to 297. Ford, although he was 
2 CONT the first incumbent president to be defeated since Herbert Hoover in 1932, 
2 CONT remained influential in Republican circles after he left office.

3 CONT massacre.
1 FAMC @F3717@
1 FAMS @F3718@
1 NOTE She had 14 children, and following the lead of their firstborn son, 
2 CONT immigrated with her family in 1634 to the Massachusetts Bay Colony at 
2 CONT Boston. There her gentle nature and exceptional powers of mind brought her 
2 CONT a following. At meetings that she organized among Boston women, and that 
2 CONT many leaders of the community later attended, she preached a doctrine of 
2 CONT salvation realized through the intuition of God's indwelling in grace. 
2 CONT Appearing to eliminate the need for the externals of institutionalized 
2 CONT belief and law, her teachings were considered an attack on the rigid moral 
2 CONT and legal codes of the Puritans of New England, as well as the authority 
2 CONT of the Massachusetts clergy. Because of this, she caused a great political 
2 CONT controversy in the colony, and strong partisanship arose on both sides. 
2 CONT Many of her supporters deserted her when the governor, Sir Henry Vane, who 
2 CONT favored her cause, lost his office to her staunch opponent, the colonial 
2 CONT leader John Winthrop. In 1637 she was tried by the General Court of 
2 CONT Massachusetts, presided over by Winthrop, on the charge of "traducing the 
2 CONT ministers" (such ministers as the brilliant preacher John Cotton). The 
2 CONT trial was a travesty of justice; Hutchinson was found guilty, 
2 CONT excommunicated, and banished from the colony. She moved with her husband 
2 CONT and family to the island of Aquidneck (now part of Rhode Island) and after 
2 CONT the death of her husband settled in what is now Pelham Bay, the Bronx, New 
2 CONT York.

1 NOTE He grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. A World War II carrier pilot in the 
2 CONT Pacific, he was discharged in 1945 with a Distinguished Flying Cross. 
2 CONT Graduated from Yale University in 1948 with a degree in economics, Bush 
2 CONT moved to Texas, where he became wealthy in the oil business. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Turning to politics, Bush ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1964 
2 CONT but won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives two years later. 
2 CONT Reelected in 1968, he gave up his seat in 1970 to run for the Senate -- 
2 CONT again unsuccessfully. President Richard M. Nixon then appointed him 
2 CONT ambassador to the United Nations (1971-72), and he subsequently held a 
2 CONT series of appointive posts that familiarized him with both the internal 
2 CONT and external politics of the U.S.: national chairman of the Republican 
2 CONT party (1973-74); chief liaison officer in Beijing (1974-75); and director 
2 CONT of the Central Intelligence Agency (1976-77). Having lost the Republican 
2 CONT nomination for the presidency in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, Bush agreed to be 
2 CONT his running mate, and became vice-president in 1981. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The 1988 Campaign
2 CONT 
2 CONT After winning reelection on the Reagan ticket in 1984, Bush competed 
2 CONT successfully for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination; as his 
2 CONT running mate he chose a U.S. senator, Dan Quayle of Indiana. During the 
2 CONT campaign Bush denounced his opponent, Massachusetts governor Michael 
2 CONT Dukakis (1933- ), for "liberalism" and promised no new taxes. He became 
2 CONT the first incumbent vice-president since 1836 to win election to the 
2 CONT presidency. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Bush as President
2 CONT 
2 CONT Dominating Bush's domestic agenda during 1989, his first year in office, 
2 CONT were measures to rescue the nation's savings and loan system and to 
2 CONT toughen U.S. efforts against illegal drugs. He responded to rapid 
2 CONT political changes in Eastern Europe by offering economic assistance to 
2 CONT Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland and by encouraging the unification of 
2 CONT East and West Germany into a country that would remain a Western ally, 
2 CONT retaining its position in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He met 
2 CONT with Mikhail Gorbachev, president of the USSR, in December 1989 at Malta, 
2 CONT where they agreed to negotiate an end to production of chemical weapons, 
2 CONT cut long-range missiles by up to 50 percent, and reduce conventional 
2 CONT forces in Europe. Later that month, Bush ordered more than 24,000 U.S. 
2 CONT troops into Panama to oust the government of General Manuel Antonio 
2 CONT Noriega (1936- ). Noriega submitted to United States capture and was held 
2 CONT in the U.S. pending trial on charges of corruption and drug trafficking. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During 1990, as the federal budget deficit continued to rise and the 
2 CONT domestic economy slid into recession, Bush proposed few new domestic 
2 CONT programs. He retreated from his "no new taxes" pledge by agreeing to a 
2 CONT deficit-reduction plan that not only cut spending but also raised income 
2 CONT tax rates. In international affairs, Bush's leadership was more 
2 CONT sure-footed. After Iraq seized Kuwait in August 1990, Bush immediately 
2 CONT sent U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia. He campaigned vigorously for an 
2 CONT international effort to reverse the Iraqi conquest, first through economic 
2 CONT sanctions and then through the use of military force. After the UN-imposed 
2 CONT deadline for Iraqi withdrawal expired on January 15, 1991, Bush -- acting 
2 CONT with UN and congressional authorization -- launched a major offensive 
2 CONT against Iraq. By the end of February, U.S.-led forces had liberated Kuwait 
2 CONT and devastated Iraq, with few allied casualties. This was known as the 
2 CONT Persian Gulf War. In July Bush met with Gorbachev to sign a strategic arms 
2 CONT reduction treaty, and in August he used diplomatic pressure to help 
2 CONT reformers in the USSR thwart a coup by hard-line Communists. His 
2 CONT popularity declined toward the end of the year as the U.S. economy 
2 CONT continued to slow, and some Americans felt that Bush was ignoring domestic 
2 CONT policy. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT The 1992 Campaign
2 CONT 
2 CONT Bush's 1992 presidential campaign was based upon his strength in foreign 
2 CONT policy and his stand on what the Republican platform called "family 
2 CONT values." Bush favored a national health care plan based upon tax credits, 
2 CONT and took a stand against federally funded abortions. Among his plans for 
2 CONT stimulating the sluggish national economy was a proposal that called for a 
2 CONT repeal of the capital gains tax, which he claimed would free up capital 
2 CONT for the wealthy to invest, thereby creating new jobs. Polls continued to 
2 CONT show Bush and Quayle lagging behind their Democratic challengers, Arkansas 
2 CONT Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee. Bush and Quayle 
2 CONT were defeated by Clinton and Gore in the November elections.

1 NOTE She was a great-great-great niece of Franklin Pierce, the 14th U.S. 
2 CONT president (1853-57). As a preparatory-school senior she met her future 
2 CONT husband and dropped out in her sophomore year at Smith College to marry 
2 CONT George Bush.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Often described as "down to earth," her straightforwardness was a key to 
2 CONT her popularity as first lady. In this role she continued her commitment to 
2 CONT a number of causes, principally the advocation of literacy. Through the 
2 CONT Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, launched in 1989, reading 
2 CONT programs throughout the United States are given support. Believing that 
2 CONT increased literacy would ameliorate other social ills, Bush frequently 
2 CONT urged those she knew or met to become reading tutors. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Her involvement also extended to areas of medical concern, especially the 
2 CONT effort to conquer leukemia, the disease that claimed one of her daughters 
2 CONT in early childhood. She volunteered her time and energy in fund-raising 
2 CONT and in visiting cancer patients. In addition she personally assisted the 
2 CONT efforts of soup kitchens and homeless people's shelters. Proceeds from 
2 CONT Bush's C. Fred's Story: A Dog's Life (1984) and Millie's Book: As Dictated 
2 CONT to Barbara Bush (1990) -- both written as accounts of life as seen from 
2 CONT her dogs' viewpoints -- helped to further her charitable interests.

2 CONT and was subject to a regency until he reached his majority in 1840. The 
2 CONT early years of his reign were marked by revolts in various parts of the 
2 CONT country. Pedro had a lifelong interest in science and was a patron of the 
2 CONT arts. He opposed slavery, which he gradually phased out of Brazilian life 
2 CONT -- outlawing the slave trade in 1850, initiating a process of emancipation 
2 CONT in 1871, and finally abolishing slavery altogether in 1888. Under his rule 
2 CONT Brazil fought a costly but successful war with Paraguay (1864-70), gaining 
2 CONT some territory as a result. Although impartial toward Brazil's rival 
2 CONT political groups, Pedro's use of the wide powers given to him by the 
2 CONT imperial constitution caused resentment, which, along with dissatisfaction 
2 CONT among slave owners, led to his overthrow and the establishment of a

2 CONT against autocratic rule in most parts of Europe. Although Ferdinand 
2 CONT attempted at first to placate the insurgents by granting a reformed

2 CONT him to reverse his stand. In 1849 he dissolved the parliament, and later 
2 CONT that year he authorized the bombardment of the rebellious cities of 
2 CONT Sicily, an atrocity that earned him the nickname of King Bomba. His rule, 
2 CONT characterized by terror and deceit, was supported by Austria but aroused

1 NOTE Because of his brilliant leadership of the Protestant forces in the Thirty 
2 CONT Years' War, became known as the Lion of the North. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT When he succeeded to the throne in 1611, Sweden was at war with Denmark, 
2 CONT Russia, and Poland. Gustav concluded a peace with Denmark in 1613, but 
2 CONT Sweden regained its southern provinces only after agreeing to pay heavy 
2 CONT financial indemnities. He waged a successful war against Russia (1613-17), 
2 CONT acquiring lands that completely cut off Russian access to the Baltic Sea. 
2 CONT From 1621 to 1629, Gustav waged a war against his cousin, Sigismund III, 
2 CONT king of Poland, who maintained a claim to the Swedish throne. Poland was 
2 CONT forced to cede lands and cities along the southern and eastern Baltic 
2 CONT coasts in 1629, and Gustav's right to the Swedish throne was ensured. A 
2 CONT religious interest in the Protestant cause and a belief that conquest of 
2 CONT northern Germany by the Holy Roman Empire would be militarily and 
2 CONT economically dangerous to Sweden impelled Gustav to enter the Thirty 
2 CONT Years' War. After securing an alliance with France, he landed his army on 
2 CONT the coast of Pomerania and succeeded in driving the imperial forces back 
2 CONT from the Baltic. His victory at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631 gave the 
2 CONT Protestants the military advantage, and they went on to occupy Bavaria and 
2 CONT Bohemia. Gustav turned his army north in 1632. At the Battle of Lützen in 
2 CONT Saxony, he defeated the imperial forces, but was himself fatally wounded. 
2 CONT Gustav was noted not only as a great general but as a capable 
2 CONT administrator. With the help of his chancellor, Count Axel Oxenstierna, 
2 CONT who managed internal affairs and diplomacy while the king was involved in 
2 CONT military campaigns, Gustav developed a sound and centralized system of 
2 CONT government and did much to develop the natural mineral resources of his 
2 CONT country. He was succeeded by his daughter, Christina.

2 CONT she attempted to increase the authority of the Crown, and in this she was

2 CONT crisis that Christina was unable to resolve. Highly intelligent, she was 
2 CONT interested in intellectual pursuits and was influenced by the French 
2 CONT philosopher René Descartes, who lived in Stockholm in 1649-50. Christina 
2 CONT never married. In 1654 she abdicated the throne, had her cousin Charles 
2 CONT recognized as her successor, and announced that she had converted to Roman 
2 CONT Catholicism. Self-exiled, she lived the rest of her life in Rome.

1 NOTE He was the founder of the Swedish royal house of Vasa and creator of an 
2 CONT independent Sweden. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Gustav was educated at the University of Uppsala. As a young man he 
2 CONT entered the army, and from 1518 to 1519 he fought against Christian II, 
2 CONT king of Denmark, who had invaded Sweden to regain the throne that the 
2 CONT Danes had lost in 1501. Gustav was taken hostage but managed to escape. He 
2 CONT was still a fugitive when he heard of Christian's massacre of his father 
2 CONT and other nationalist Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520. With an army of 
2 CONT peasants, Gustav led a successful revolt (1521-23) and drove the Danes out 
2 CONT of Sweden. His victory resulted in the dissolution of the Union of Kalmar, 
2 CONT which in 1397 had placed Sweden and Norway under the Danish crown. Gustav 
2 CONT was administrator of the kingdom from 1521 to 1523, when the Riksdag, or 
2 CONT national assembly, elected him king. He strengthened his political hold 
2 CONT and restored order by introducing the Reformation into Sweden. The Roman

1 NOTE She was the founder of the Kalmar Union.  After her father's death, she 
2 CONT had her young son, Olaf, elected king of Denmark and governed in his 
2 CONT stead, as she also did in Norway after her husband's death in 1380. When 
2 CONT Olaf died in 1387, she was elected head of state in both countries; at the 
2 CONT same time she had her grandnephew, Eric VII of Pomerania (1382-1459), 
2 CONT acknowledged as her heir. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Margaret faced opposition abroad from King Albert of Sweden (circa 
2 CONT 1340-1412) and the count of Holstein, as well as from the encroaching 
2 CONT Hanseatic cities. Many of the Swedish nobles, however, supported her 
2 CONT against Albert, who was finally defeated and deposed in 1389; the Swedes 
2 CONT then accepted Margaret as their queen. As head of the three realms, she 
2 CONT had Eric crowned king of Denmark and Sweden in 1397 (he had been accepted 
2 CONT as king of Norway in 1389) and had a treaty signed at Kalmar that created 
2 CONT a union of all three countries. This was the first time the Scandinavian 
2 CONT lands were joined under one king. Even after Eric came of age, however, 
2 CONT Margaret retained the reins of government. She made great efforts to 
2 CONT amalgamate the three realms, ruling with a firm hand that strengthened 
2 CONT royal authority. She died while campaigning against Holstein. The Union of 
2 CONT Kalmar lasted nominally until 1523, when Sweden broke away. Denmark and 
2 CONT Norway, however, remained united until 1814.

1 NOTE He succeeded his grandfather, Håkon V, as king of Norway and was elected

2 CONT power. In 1355 he handed Norway over to his son, Håkon VI, for whom he had 
2 CONT acted as regent since 1343. In Sweden another son deposed Magnus in 1356. 
2 CONT Magnus, however, regained the crown in 1359, only to be deposed again in

2 CONT to Denmark. Håkon VI waged war in support of his father, but Magnus did 
2 CONT not again gain control of his realm. Magnus was imprisoned for some time 
2 CONT but escaped in 1371 to Norway, where he lived until his death.

1 NOTE In 978 he became king of Cashel, capital of the ancient kingdom of 
2 CONT Munster. By 984 he controlled all of Munster, and in 1001 he was 
2 CONT acknowledged the chief king of Ireland. From his youth, Brian had been 
2 CONT fighting the Vikings, who had occupied part of the country. In the Battle 
2 CONT of Clontarf (April 23, 1014), his sons led an Irish army to a decisive 
2 CONT victory over the Vikings, thereby permanently destroying their power in 
2 CONT Ireland. Brian, too aged to fight, was awaiting news of the battle when he 
2 CONT was slain in his tent by a Viking intruder. Brian is one of the great 
2 CONT heroes of the Irish, but fact and legend have become so intertwined in the 
2 CONT accounts of his life that an accurate biography cannot be given.

1 NAME Mathghamhna //
1 SEX M
1 FAMC @F4199@
1 NOTE His descendants are the O'Mahonys.  There are a great many O'Mahony in 
2 CONT Ireland-the name is included, usually without the prefix O, among the 
2 CONT commonest surnames.  It belongs almost exclusively to West Munster, the 
2 CONT great Mahony and O'Mahony births being registered in Co. Cork, 
2 CONT particularly in the area associated historically with the O'Mahony sept.  
2 CONT Their cheiftains were powerful, being often described as princes.  Their 
2 CONT principal territory comprised the modern barony of Kinelmeaky and extended 
2 CONT to the sea, with a fortified castle called Rosbrian off the coast of 
2 CONT south-west Cork.  The name O Mathghamhna -- in modernized spelling 
2 CONT O'Mahuna -- is derived from their ancestor Mathghamhna, whose mother was a 
2 CONT daughter of Brian Boru.  Mathghamhan is the Irish word for a bear.  He was 
2 CONT killed, with many more of the Desmond fighting men, at the Battle of 
2 CONT Clontarf in 1014.  Another famous soldier of the name was Count Daniel 
2 CONT O'Mahony (d. 1714), generla in the Irish Brigade in the service of France 
2 CONT and hero of the battle of Cremona, the best known of the many O'Mahonys 
2 CONT who served with distinction in the French and Spanish armies.  John 
2 CONT O'Mahony (1816-1877) of Kilbeheny near Mitchelstown, was the celebrated 
2 CONT Fenian leader.  In the literary sphere the best-known is Sylvester Mahony 
2 CONT (1804-1866), who under the pseudonym of Father Prout was the author of 
2 CONT "The Bells of Shandon" and other poems assiciated with Cork.  Father 
2 CONT Francis O'Mahony, Provincial of the Irish Franciscans from 1626 to 1629, 
2 CONT was also known as Father Francis Matthews.  Matthews is rare as an 
2 CONT anglicized form of O'Mahony, but not unusual in Ulster as a synonym of 
2 CONT MacMahon.

2 CONT the son of Seleucus II and brother of Seleucus III, whom he succeeded. He 
2 CONT was the most distinguished of the Seleucids. Having made vassal states out 
2 CONT of Parthia and Bactria, he warred successfully against the Egyptian king

2 CONT Lebanon. He later became involved in a conflict with the Romans, who 
2 CONT defeated him at Thermopylae in 191 bc and at Magnesia (now Manisa, Turkey) 
2 CONT in 190 bc. As the price of peace, he was forced to surrender all his

2 CONT Antiochus, who early in his reign had restored the Seleucid Empire, 
2 CONT finally forfeited its influence in the eastern Mediterranean by his 
2 CONT failure to recognize the rising power of Rome.

1 NOTE His original was name Ochus. He was an illegitimate son hence his Greek

2 CONT king for a few weeks; another half brother, Sogdianus, murdered Xerxes II 
2 CONT and was king for a few months; then Ochus murdered Sogdianus and ascended 
2 CONT the throne, assuming the name of Darius. In the early years of his reign 
2 CONT the power of Athens prevented him from interfering in the affairs of 
2 CONT Greece. But after Athens was defeated by Syracuse in 413 bc, Darius II 
2 CONT intervened and supported Sparta for the remaining years of the 
2 CONT Peloponnesian War. In 407 bc he sent his son Cyrus the Younger to command 
2 CONT the combined Persian and Spartan forces in Asia Minor. Three years later 
2 CONT he died. The 20 years of Darius's reign were notable primarily for 
2 CONT ruthless suppression of a series of revolts within his empire.

1 NOTE (Persian Khshayarsha)  Ascending the throne upon the death of his father, 
2 CONT he subdued a rebellion in Egypt, and then spent three years preparing a 
2 CONT great fleet and army to punish the Greeks for aiding the Ionian cities in 
2 CONT 498 bc and for their victory over the Persians at Marathon in 490 bc. The 
2 CONT Greek historian Herodotus gives as the combined strength of Xerxes' land 
2 CONT and naval forces the incredible total of 2,641,610 warriors. Xerxes is 
2 CONT said to have crossed the Hellespont by a bridge of boats more than a 
2 CONT kilometer in length and to have cut a canal through the isthmus of Mount 
2 CONT Athos. During the spring of 480 bc he marched with his forces through 
2 CONT Thrace, Thessaly, and Locris. At Thermopylae 300 Spartans, under their 
2 CONT king, Leonidas I, made a courageous but futile stand, delaying the 
2 CONT Persians for ten days. Xerxes then advanced into Attica and burned Athens, 
2 CONT which had been abandoned by the Greeks. At the Battle of Salamís later in 
2 CONT 480 bc, however, his fleet was defeated by a much smaller contingent of 
2 CONT Greek warships commanded by the Athenian Themistocles. Xerxes thereupon 
2 CONT retired to Asia Minor, leaving his army in Greece under the command of his 
2 CONT brother-in-law, Mardonius (fl. 500-479 bc), who was slain at Plataea the 
2 CONT following year. Xerxes was murdered at Persepolis by Artabanus (died 464 
2 CONT bc), captain of the palace guard; he was succeeded by his son Artaxerxes I 
2 CONT (reigned 465-425 bc). Xerxes is generally identified as the Ahasuerus of 
2 CONT the Book of Esther.

1 NOTE Darius I, called The Great (558?-486 bc), king of Persia (521?-486 bc), 
2 CONT son of the Persian noble Hystaspes (588-521 bc), and a member of a royal 
2 CONT Persian family, the Achaemenids. In 522 bc, on the death of King Cambyses 
2 CONT II, a group of Magian priests tried to give the throne to one of their 
2 CONT number, the usurper Gaumata; he pretended to be Smerdis (died about 523 
2 CONT bc), the murdered brother of Cambyses II. In 521, Darius defeated Gaumata 
2 CONT and was chosen king of Persia. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The first two years of his reign were occupied with suppressing 
2 CONT rebellions, the most important of which occurred in Babylonia. Thereafter 
2 CONT he devoted himself to reforming the internal organization of Persia and 
2 CONT making its outer borders secure. He reorganized the vast empire into 20 
2 CONT satrapies, built highways, organized a postal system, reformed the 
2 CONT currency, encouraged commerce, and won the goodwill of large portions of 
2 CONT the heterogeneous population. Because he respected their religions, he was 
2 CONT honored by the Jews, whom he permitted to complete the rebuilding of the 
2 CONT Temple at Jerusalem in 516; by the Egyptians, whose high priest he 
2 CONT consulted; and by the Greeks of Asia Minor, whose oracles supported him 
2 CONT during the revolt of the Greek cities. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In protecting the borders of the empire, Darius conquered new territories 
2 CONT along the Indus River in the east and in the Caucasus Mountains in the 
2 CONT northeast, but his expedition in 516 against the tribes of the Danube 
2 CONT River failed. In 499 a revolt broke out among the Ionian Greek cities of 
2 CONT Asia Minor, partly encouraged by some of the Greek cities on the mainland. 
2 CONT The revolt was suppressed by 493, and Darius prepared to punish the 
2 CONT mainland Greeks for their intervention. In 492 an army under Mardonius 
2 CONT (flourished 500-479 bc), the son-in-law of Darius, crossed the Bosporus 
2 CONT into Thrace but was unable to reach Greece because the supply ships were 
2 CONT wrecked off Mount Athos. Two years later, a strong Persian force under the 
2 CONT joint command of Artaphernes (flourished 5th century bc), a nephew of 
2 CONT Darius, and the Mede commander Datis (flourished 5th century bc) invaded 
2 CONT Greece from the north but was defeated at Marathon. A third expedition was 
2 CONT being prepared when Darius died. He left a detailed account of his reign, 
2 CONT inscribed in three languages on a towering rock. This Behistun 
2 CONT Inscription, the first English transcription of which was complete in 
2 CONT 1849, confirms many details of the life of Darius.

1 NOTE Cyrus the Great (circa 600-529 bc), king of Persia (550-529 bc). He was 
2 CONT the son of Cambyses I, a descendant of Achaemenes (Hakhamanish) 
2 CONT (flourished 7th century bc), and a member of the Achaemenid dynasty. When 
2 CONT Cyrus became (558 bc) ruler of the Persian district of Anshan, the 
2 CONT district was subject to the Medes; five years later he led a rebellion 
2 CONT against the Medes that resulted in the capture of King Astyages (reigned 
2 CONT about 584-c. 550 bc) and the overthrow (550 bc) of the Median Empire. 
2 CONT Thereafter Cyrus called himself king of Persia and ruled a territory 
2 CONT extending from the Halys River in Asia Minor, eastern border of Lydia, to 
2 CONT the Babylonian Empire on the south and east. Babylon, Egypt, Lydia, and 
2 CONT the city-state of Sparta in Greece combined to curb the power of Cyrus, 
2 CONT but in 546 bc the Persians added Lydia to their realm, and in 539 bc the 
2 CONT kingdom of Babylon fell to Cyrus. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT The Persian Empire was the most powerful state in the world until its 
2 CONT conquest two centuries later by Alexander the Great. Cyrus was an able and 
2 CONT merciful ruler. Significant among his deeds was his granting of permission 
2 CONT to the Jews to return from their exile in Babylon to their native Israel 
2 CONT to rebuild the Temple of Solomon. Cyrus died while leading an expedition 
2 CONT against the eastern tribe, the Massagetae, and was succeeded by his son,

1 NOTE He reigned 605-562 bc, greatest king of the neo-Babylonian, or Chaldean, 
2 CONT dynasty, who conquered much of southwestern Asia; known also for his 
2 CONT extensive building in the major cities of Babylonia. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Nebuchadnezzar commanded a Babylonian army late in his father's reign and 
2 CONT in 605 bc triumphed over Egyptian forces at the decisive Battle of 
2 CONT Carchemish in Syria, which made Babylonia the primary military power in 
2 CONT the Middle East. After his father's death, Nebuchadnezzar returned to 
2 CONT Babylon and ascended the throne on September 7, 605 bc. During the next 
2 CONT eight years he campaigned extensively in the west against Syria, 
2 CONT Palestine, and Egypt and against the Arabs. On March 16, 597 bc, he 
2 CONT captured Jerusalem and took Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and many of his 
2 CONT people captive to Babylonia. He was subsequently troubled by major revolts 
2 CONT in Babylonia (594 bc) and in Judah (588-587 bc), which were vigorously 
2 CONT punished; many more Jews were exiled to Babylonia. Nebuchadnezzar also 
2 CONT conducted a 13-year siege of the Phoenician city of Tyre and launched an 
2 CONT invasion of Egypt in 568 bc. During the latter part of his reign, as the 
2 CONT empire of the Medes increased in power to the north and east, 
2 CONT Nebuchadnezzar built a wall, known as the Median Wall, in northern 
2 CONT Babylonia to keep out the potential invader. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Nebuchadnezzar's conquests brought in much booty and tribute, creating an 
2 CONT age of prosperity for Babylonia. He undertook an ambitious construction 
2 CONT program, rebuilding the temples in the major cult cities and refurbishing 
2 CONT his capital at Babylon with a splendid ziggurat (pyramid temple) as well 
2 CONT as other shrines, palaces, fortification walls, and processional ways. 
2 CONT Later legend credited him with building one of the Seven Wonders of the 
2 CONT Ancient World, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, for his Median wife 
2 CONT Amyitis. Nebuchadnezzar died in early October 562 bc and was succeeded by 
2 CONT his son Amel-Marduk (reigned 562-560 bc; the biblical Evil-Merodach).

2 CONT Dynasty. During the early part of his reign Ramses fought to regain the 
2 CONT territory in Africa and western Asia that Egypt had held during the 16th 
2 CONT and 15th centuries bc. His principal opponents were the Hittites, a 
2 CONT powerful people of Asia Minor, against whom he waged a long war. The major 
2 CONT battle of this war was fought in 1274 at Kadesh, in northern Syria, and 
2 CONT was hailed by Ramses as a great triumph. Neither power achieved a 
2 CONT conclusive victory, however, and in 1258 bc a treaty was signed whereby 
2 CONT the contested lands were divided and Ramses agreed to marry the daughter 
2 CONT of the Hittite king. The remaining years of his rule were distinguished by 
2 CONT the construction of such monuments as the rock-hewn temple of Abu Simbel, 
2 CONT the great hypostyle hall in the Temple of Amon at al-Karnak, and the 
2 CONT mortuary temple at Thebes, known as the Ramesseum.

1 NOTE Ikhnaton was the last important ruler of the 18th Dynasty and notable as 
2 CONT the first historical figure to establish a religion based on the concept 
2 CONT of monotheism. He established the cult of Aton, or Aten, the sun god or 
2 CONT solar disk, which he believed to be a universal, omnipresent spirit and 
2 CONT the sole creator of the universe.  After he established the new religion, 
2 CONT sometimes referred to as solar monotheism, he changed his name from the 
2 CONT royal designation Amenhotep IV to Ikhnaton, meaning "Aton is satisfied." 
2 CONT He moved his capital from Thebes to Akhetaton, or Tell el-Amarna, a new 
2 CONT city devoted to the celebration of Aton, and he ordered the obliteration 
2 CONT of all traces of the polytheistic religion of his ancestors. He also 
2 CONT fought bitterly against the powerful priests who attempted to maintain the 
2 CONT worship of the state god Amon, or Amen. This religious revolution had a 
2 CONT profound effect on Egyptian artists, who turned from the ritualistic forms 
2 CONT to which they had been confined to a much more realistic representation of 
2 CONT nature as evidence of the all-embracing power of the sun, Aton. A new 
2 CONT religious literature also arose. This blossoming of culture, however, did 
2 CONT not survive Ikhnaton. Under his son-in-law, Tutankhamen, the capital was 
2 CONT moved back to Thebes; the old polytheistic religion was restored; and 
2 CONT Egyptian art once more became ritualized.

1 NOTE Cambyses II (reigned 529-522 bc), king of Persia, son of Cyrus the Great, 
2 CONT whom he succeeded. In order to maintain control over the Persian Empire, 
2 CONT Cambyses had his younger brother, Smerdis (died about 523 bc), murdered. 
2 CONT He then led an expedition to conquer Egypt, the sole independent kingdom 
2 CONT in the Middle East after the conquest of Asia by his father. Cambyses 
2 CONT defeated Psamtik III, king of Egypt (reigned 526-525 bc), and succeeded in 
2 CONT conquering Egypt as far south as Nubia, but he failed in later attacks on 
2 CONT the Egyptian oasis of Ammonium (now Siwa) and in campaigns in Ethiopia. 
2 CONT During his absence in Egypt, a usurper, Gaumata (reigned 522 bc), claimed 
2 CONT to be Smerdis and seized the throne of Persia. The death of Smerdis had

1 NOTE He is the semilegendary king of the Britons who fought against the 
2 CONT invading Anglo-Saxons. Although some historians consider him a mythical 
2 CONT figure, there is reason to believe that a historical Arthur may have led 
2 CONT the long resistance of the Britons against the invaders. According to 
2 CONT legend, Arthur was the son of Uther Pendragon, king of Britain. Kept in 
2 CONT obscurity during childhood, he was suddenly presented to the people as 
2 CONT their king. He proved a wise and valiant ruler. He gathered a great 
2 CONT company of knights in his court; problems of precedence were avoided by 
2 CONT the use of a round table at gatherings. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT With his queen, Guinevere, he maintained a magnificent court at 
2 CONT Caerleon-upon-Usk (perhaps the legendary Camelot) on the southern border 
2 CONT of Wales, where the Britons longest maintained their hold. His wars and 
2 CONT victories extended to the continent of Europe, where he successfully 
2 CONT defied the forces of the Roman Empire until he was called home because of 
2 CONT the acts of his nephew Mordred, who had rebelled and seized his kingdom. 
2 CONT In the final battle of Camlan, in southwestern England, the king and the 
2 CONT traitor both fell, pierced by each other's spears. Arthur was mysteriously 
2 CONT carried away to the mythical island of Avalon to be healed of his 
2 CONT "grievous wound." The first allusion to Arthur is in the Welsh poem Y 
2 CONT Gododdin (circa 600). He is again mentioned in Historia Britonum (c. 850) 
2 CONT of the Welsh historian Nennius (flourished about 800); the Annales 
2 CONT Cambriae, in a 10th-century manuscript, mentions him, giving 537 as the 
2 CONT date of his death; and the fully developed legend appears in the Historia 
2 CONT Regum Britanniae (c. 1139) of the English chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth.

1 NOTE (Welsh Gwenhwyfar) She appears in the 12th-century Historia cycle of 
2 CONT Arthurian romances by the English chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth as 
2 CONT Gwanhumara, a beautiful woman who became a nun after the defeat of King 
2 CONT Arthur by Mordred. In the 12th century romance Le chevalier à la charette 
2 CONT (The Knight of the Cart), the French poet Chrétien de Troyes introduced 
2 CONT the story of the tragic love affair between Guinevere and Sir Lancelot du 
2 CONT Lac. The same story was treated by later English writers, notably by Sir 
2 CONT Thomas Malory in Le morte d'Arthur (1485) and by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 
2 CONT Idylls of the King (1859-85).

1 NOTE in Dutch, Willem Frederik.  He was also grand duke of Luxembourg 
2 CONT (1815-40). In the War of the First Coalition against revolutionary France, 
2 CONT William commanded the Dutch army from 1793 until 1795, when his country 
2 CONT was overrun by the French. He thereafter lived in England and Germany, 
2 CONT returning to the Netherlands in 1813. The Treaty of Paris (1814) provided 
2 CONT that the Netherlands and Belgium be united into a single kingdom, and 
2 CONT William was proclaimed its first king. In 1815, by decision of the 
2 CONT Congress of Vienna, he ceded his hereditary properties in Germany to

1 NOTE (in Dutch, Willem Frederik George Lodewijk)  He was also the grand duke of 
2 CONT Luxembourg (1840-49).  He was educated at the University of Oxford. When 
2 CONT the French overran the Netherlands in 1795, William and his family were 
2 CONT exiled for 18 years. As William, prince of Orange, he entered the British 
2 CONT army in 1811 during the Napoleonic Wars and served as aide-de-camp to 
2 CONT General Arthur Wellesley, later 1st duke of Wellington; William commanded 
2 CONT the Dutch and Belgian forces at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. That year, 
2 CONT his father became king of the Netherlands and Belgium. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT When the Belgians rebelled against Dutch rule in 1830, William advocated 
2 CONT greater autonomy for them, but the king rejected his proposed concessions. 
2 CONT The following year, Dutch forces under the younger William's command 
2 CONT subdued the Belgians. In 1832, however, France intervened on behalf of the 
2 CONT Belgians, forcing William to withdraw, and in 1839 Belgium was granted 
2 CONT independence. William succeeded to the throne upon the abdication of his 
2 CONT father in 1840. The chief event of his reign was the grant in 1848 of a 
2 CONT liberalized constitution that greatly abridged royal power. He was 
2 CONT succeeded by his son William III.

1 NOTE He was conqueror of the Persian Empire, and one of the greatest military 
2 CONT geniuses of all times. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Aristotle was Alexander's tutor; he gave Alexander a thorough training in 
2 CONT rhetoric and literature and stimulated his interest in science, medicine, 
2 CONT and philosophy. In the summer of 336 bc Philip was assassinated, and 
2 CONT Alexander ascended to the Macedonian throne. He found himself surrounded 
2 CONT by enemies at home and threatened by rebellion abroad. Alexander disposed 
2 CONT quickly of all conspirators and domestic enemies by ordering their 
2 CONT execution. Then he descended on Thessaly, where partisans of independence 
2 CONT had gained ascendancy, and restored Macedonian rule. Before the end of the 
2 CONT summer of 336 bc he had reestablished his position in Greece and was 
2 CONT elected by a congress of states at Corinth. In 335 bc as general of the 
2 CONT Greeks in a campaign against the Persians, originally planned by his 
2 CONT father, he carried out a successful campaign against the defecting 
2 CONT Thracians, penetrating to the Danube River. On his return he crushed in a 
2 CONT single week the threatening Illyrians and then hastened to Thebes, which 
2 CONT had revolted. He took the city by storm and razed it, sparing only the 
2 CONT temples of the gods and the house of the Greek lyric poet Pindar, and 
2 CONT selling the surviving inhabitants, about 8000 in number, into slavery. 
2 CONT Alexander's promptness in crushing the revolt of Thebes brought the other 
2 CONT Greek states into instant and abject submission. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Alexander began his war against Persia in the spring of 334 bc by crossing 
2 CONT the Hellespont (modern Dardanelles) with an army of 35,000 Macedonian and 
2 CONT Greek troops; his chief officers, all Macedonians, included Antigonus, 
2 CONT Ptolemy, and Seleucus. At the river Granicus, near the ancient city of 
2 CONT Troy, he attacked an army of Persians and Greek mercenaries totaling 
2 CONT 40,000 men. His forces defeated the enemy and, according to tradition, 
2 CONT lost only 110 men; after this battle all the states of Asia Minor 
2 CONT submitted to him. In passing through Phrygia he is said to have cut with 
2 CONT his sword the Gordian knot. Continuing to advance southward, Alexander 
2 CONT encountered the main Persian army, commanded by King Darius III, at Issus, 
2 CONT in northeastern Syria. The size of Darius's army is unknown; the ancient 
2 CONT tradition that it contained 500,000 men is now considered a fantastic 
2 CONT exaggeration. The Battle of Issus, in 333, ended in a great victory for 
2 CONT Alexander. Cut off from his base, Darius fled northward, abandoning his 
2 CONT mother, wife, and children to Alexander, who treated them with the respect 
2 CONT due to royalty. Tyre, a strongly fortified seaport, offered obstinate 
2 CONT resistance, but Alexander took it by storm in 332 after a siege of seven 
2 CONT months. Alexander captured Gaza next and then passed on into Egypt, where 
2 CONT he was greeted as a deliverer. By these successes he secured control of 
2 CONT the entire eastern Mediterranean coastline. Later in 332 he founded, at 
2 CONT the mouth of the Nile River, the city of Alexandria, which later became 
2 CONT the literary, scientific, and commercial center of the Greek world. 
2 CONT Cyrene, the capital of the ancient North African kingdom of Cyrenaica, 
2 CONT submitted to Alexander soon afterward, extending his dominion to 
2 CONT Carthaginian territory. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In the spring of 331 Alexander made a pilgrimage to the great temple and 
2 CONT oracle of Amon-Ra, Egyptian god of the sun, whom the Greeks identified 
2 CONT with Zeus. The earlier Egyptian pharaohs were believed to be sons of 
2 CONT Amon-Ra; and Alexander, the new ruler of Egypt, wanted the god to 
2 CONT acknowledge him as his son. The pilgrimage apparently was successful, and 
2 CONT it may have confirmed in him a belief in his own divine origin. Turning 
2 CONT northward again, he reorganized his forces at Tyre and started for Babylon 
2 CONT with an army of 40,000 infantry and 7000 cavalry. Crossing the Euphrates 
2 CONT and the Tigris rivers, he met Darius at the head of an army of unknown 
2 CONT size, which, according to the exaggerated accounts of antiquity, was said 
2 CONT to number a million men; this army he completely defeated in the Battle of 
2 CONT Guagamela, on October 1, 331. Darius fled as he had done at Issus and was 
2 CONT later slain by two of his own generals. Babylon surrendered after 
2 CONT Gaugamela, and the city of Susa with its enormous treasures was soon 
2 CONT conquered. Then, in midwinter, Alexander forced his way to Persepolis, the 
2 CONT Persian capital. After plundering the royal treasuries and taking other 
2 CONT rich booty, he burned the city during a drunken binge and thus completed 
2 CONT the destruction of the ancient Persian Empire. His domain now extended 
2 CONT along and beyond the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, including modern 
2 CONT Afghanistan and Balochistan, and northward into Bactria and Sogdiana, the 
2 CONT modern Russian Turkestan, also known as Central Asia. It had taken 
2 CONT Alexander only three years, from the spring of 330 bc to the spring of 327 
2 CONT bc, to master this vast area. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In order to complete his conquest of the remnants of the Persian Empire, 
2 CONT which had once included part of western India, Alexander crossed the Indus 
2 CONT River in 326 bc, and invaded the Punjab as far as the river Hyphasis 
2 CONT (modern Beas); at this point the Macedonians rebelled and refused to go 
2 CONT farther. He then constructed a fleet and passed down the Indus, reaching 
2 CONT its mouth in September 325 bc. The fleet then sailed to the Persian Gulf. 
2 CONT With his army, he returned overland across the desert to Media. Shortages 
2 CONT of food and water caused severe losses and hardship among his troops. 
2 CONT Alexander spent about a year organizing his dominions and completing a 
2 CONT survey of the Persian Gulf in preparation for further conquests. He 
2 CONT arrived in Babylon in the spring of 323 bc. In June he contracted a fever 
2 CONT and died. He left his empire, in his own words, "to the strongest"; this 
2 CONT ambiguous testament resulted in dire conflicts for half a century. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Alexander was one of the greatest generals of all time, noted for his 
2 CONT brilliance as a tactician and troop leader and for the rapidity with which 
2 CONT he could traverse great expanses of territory. He was usually brave and 
2 CONT generous, but could be cruel and ruthless when politics demanded. The 
2 CONT theory has been advanced that he was actually an alcoholic having, for 
2 CONT example, killed his friend Clitus (died 328 bc) in a drunken fury. He 
2 CONT later regretted this act deeply. As a statesman and ruler he had grandiose 
2 CONT plans; according to many modern historians he cherished a scheme for 
2 CONT uniting the East and the West in a world empire, a new and enlightened 
2 CONT "world brotherhood of all men." He trained thousands of Persian youths in 
2 CONT Macedonian tactics and enrolled them in his army. He himself adopted 
2 CONT Persian manners and married Eastern wives; and he encouraged and bribed 
2 CONT his officers to take Persian wives. Shortly before he died, Alexander 
2 CONT ordered the Greek cities to worship him as a god. Although he probably 
2 CONT gave the order for political reasons, he was, in his own view and that of 
2 CONT his contemporaries, of divine birth. The order was largely nullified by 
2 CONT his death shortly after he issued it. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT To bind his conquests together, Alexander founded a number of cities, most 
2 CONT of them named Alexandria, along his line of march; these cities were well 
2 CONT located, well paved, and provided with good water supplies. Greek veterans 
2 CONT from his army settled in them; young men, traders, merchants, and scholars 
2 CONT were attracted to them; Greek culture was introduced; and the Greek 
2 CONT language became widely known. Thus, Alexander vastly extended the 
2 CONT influence of Greek civilization and prepared the way for the kingdoms of 
2 CONT the Hellenistic period and the conquests of the Roman Empire.

1 NOTE From 367 to 365, Philip was a hostage in Thebes, and during that period he 
2 CONT observed the military techniques of Thebes, then the greatest power in 
2 CONT Greece. In 364 he returned to Macedonia. In 359 he was made regent for his 
2 CONT infant nephew Amyntas; later that year he seized the throne for himself. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Faced by internal dissensions and attacked on all sides, he reorganized 
2 CONT the Macedonian army on the model of the Theban phalanx. In less than two 
2 CONT years he had secured the safety of his kingdom and firmly established 
2 CONT himself on the throne. From then on his policy was aggressive. In 357 he 
2 CONT conquered the Athenian colony of Amphipolis in Thrace, gaining possession 
2 CONT of the gold mines of Mount Pangaeus, which financed his subsequent wars. 
2 CONT In 356 he captured Potidea in Chalcidice and Pydna on the Thermaic Gulf. 
2 CONT In 355 he captured the Thracian town of Crenides, which, under its new 
2 CONT name, Philippi, soon acquired great wealth and fame. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 354 Philip conquered Methone and then advanced into Thessaly. By 352 he 
2 CONT had reached the pass of Thermopylae, which, however, he did not attempt to 
2 CONT take, because it was strongly guarded by the Athenians. In 351 the great 
2 CONT Athenian orator Demosthenes delivered the first of his Philippics, a 
2 CONT series of speeches warning the Greeks about the Macedonian menace to Greek 
2 CONT liberty. By 348 Philip had conquered Thrace and Chalcidice. Two years 
2 CONT later he made peace with Athens, which had been at war with him in defense 
2 CONT of its ally, the Chalcidian city Olynthus. Philip was next requested by 
2 CONT the Thebans to interfere in the sacred war against Phocis. He marched into 
2 CONT Phocis in 346 and destroyed its cities. Thereafter Macedonia replaced 
2 CONT Phocis in the Amphictyonic League, giving Philip the right to participate 
2 CONT in Greek political affairs; in 338 the council appointed Philip commander 
2 CONT of the league forces. The Athenians, aroused by Demosthenes, united with 
2 CONT the Thebans against Philip, but their combined army was utterly defeated 
2 CONT in 338 at the Battle of Chaeronea. Philip's victory made him complete 
2 CONT master of Greece and ended Greek independence. Two years later, while 
2 CONT preparing to invade Persia, he was assassinated. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Philip was the greatest statesman and general of his time. He laid the 
2 CONT foundation of the Macedonian military power employed by his son, Alexander 
2 CONT the Great, to conquer and Hellenize the Middle East. A treasure-filled 
2 CONT royal tomb, believed to be Philip's, was excavated at Vergina, near 
2 CONT Thessaloníka, Greece, in 1977.

1 NOTE Cyrus the Younger (424-401 bc), Persian prince, son of Darius II, king of 
2 CONT Persia, and brother of Artaxerxes II (reigned 404-358? bc). In 408 bc he 
2 CONT was made satrap (governor) of the Persian provinces in western Asia Minor 
2 CONT and was ordered to assist the forces of Sparta during the last years of 
2 CONT the Peloponnesian War. When Darius died and Artaxerxes succeeded (404 bc) 
2 CONT to the throne, Cyrus planned a revolt, but his plan was revealed by 
2 CONT Tissaphernes (f. 413-395 bc), the satrap of Caria. Cyrus was pardoned 
2 CONT through the influence of his mother, Parysatis (died 395? bc), and sent 
2 CONT back to his satrapy. There he collected a force of about 100,000 Persian 
2 CONT subjects and 13,000 Greeks, most of the latter Spartans influenced by his 
2 CONT aid in the Peloponnesian War. Under the pretext of leading an expedition 
2 CONT against bandits in Pisidia, he set forth from Sardis toward Babylon, the 
2 CONT Persian capital. In 401 bc the armies of Artaxerxes met those of Cyrus in 
2 CONT battle at Cunaxa, near the Euphrates River, and Cyrus was killed while 
2 CONT fighting. An important repercussion of this battle was the strategic 
2 CONT retreat of the Greeks through the heart of Persian territory to the Black 
2 CONT Sea, exposing the military weakness of the Persians to the Greek world. 
2 CONT The story of Cyrus's revolt and of the march of the Ten Thousand Greeks 
2 CONT was told by the Athenian general and historian Xenophon in the Anabasis.

1 NOTE He was an English courtier and military commander. His father, Edmund 
2 CONT Dudley, a lawyer involved in tax extortion under King Henry VII, was 
2 CONT executed upon the accession of King Henry VIII. Dudley's mother remarried, 
2 CONT and his stepfather gained him favor at court. He was made governor of 
2 CONT Calais in 1538 and warden of the Scottish marches in 1542, the year he was 
2 CONT elevated to the peerage as Viscount Lisle. He was created earl of Warwick 
2 CONT in 1546. Upon the accession of King Edward VI, a minor, in 1547, Dudley 
2 CONT became joint regent and lord chamberlain of England. After subduing a 
2 CONT Scottish rebellion in 1547, he embarked on a struggle for power with the 
2 CONT Seymour family, headed by Edward Seymour. Dudley was created duke of 
2 CONT Northumberland in 1550 and two years later disposed of his rival, Seymour, 
2 CONT by having him tried and executed on false charges. Subsequently, he 
2 CONT conspired to gain the succession to the English throne for his heirs by 
2 CONT marrying his son, Guildford, to Lady Jane Grey. His resistance to the 
2 CONT accession of Queen Mary I led to his execution in 1553.

1 NOTE He was called James Fitzroy and James Crofts.  He was a pretender to the 
2 CONT British throne.  James was brought to England in 1662, where Charles 
2 CONT subsequently acknowledged him as his son and created him duke of Monmouth. 
2 CONT He married and took his wife's surname and the title duke of Buccleuch. 
2 CONT Captain of the king's troops in 1668, Monmouth was appointed captain 
2 CONT general of all English forces in 1678. He defeated the Scottish 
2 CONT Covenanters at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679.
2 CONT   
2 CONT Charles II had no legitimate heirs. The English Protestant leaders tried 
2 CONT to force the king to name Monmouth, also a Protestant, as successor, but 
2 CONT Charles instead named his brother James, a Roman Catholic, and banished 
2 CONT Monmouth from England. The initial success of the Exclusion Bill, a 
2 CONT measure barring James from succession, permitted Monmouth to return to 
2 CONT London, but he fled again in 1683 after the disclosure of the Rye House 
2 CONT Plot. On his father's death in 1685, Monmouth returned to England to claim 
2 CONT the Crown. He gathered followers and succeeded in capturing Axminster and 
2 CONT Taunton, but was defeated by the English soldier John Churchill, 1st duke 
2 CONT of Marlborough. He was captured and executed for treason.

1 NOTE In 1452 he became count of Charolais. When King Louis XI of France forced 
2 CONT Philip to cede some towns on the Somme River, Charles formed the League of 
2 CONT the Public Weal, an alliance of noblemen. League forces threatened Paris 
2 CONT and defeated the king at Montlhéry, near Paris, in 1465. The result was 
2 CONT the Treaty of Conflans, by which the towns on the Somme were restored and 
2 CONT the counties of Boulogne, Guines, and Ponthieu were granted to Charles. 
2 CONT Succeeding his father as duke in 1467, he became ruler of the territories 
2 CONT that constitute the Low Countries as well as the duchy of Burgundy and 
2 CONT Franche Comté, or the Free County of Burgundy. In 1468, Charles formed an 
2 CONT alliance with his wife's brother, Edward IV, king of England. Richer and 
2 CONT more powerful than any other prince, Charles planned to restore the old 
2 CONT kingdom of Burgundy and fought a series of intermittent wars with France. 
2 CONT In 1475 Charles made himself master of Lorraine. In March of the following 
2 CONT year he invaded Switzerland and was defeated at Grandson. Three months 
2 CONT later he suffered a still more severe defeat at Morat (now Murten). 
2 CONT Nevertheless Charles refused to agree to peace terms and laid siege to 
2 CONT Nancy in October 1476. There he was defeated and killed. His daughter and 
2 CONT heiress, Mary of Burgundy, soon thereafter married Maximilian of Habsburg, 
2 CONT but Maximilian was forced to relinquish all the Burgundian lands except 
2 CONT Flanders.

1 NOTE During World War II, when the German army invaded Belgium and France, 
2 CONT Leopold, with the bulk of the Belgian army, was surrounded by the Germans 
2 CONT and quickly capitulated. His surrender incurred the violent disapproval of 
2 CONT the Belgian people and brought accusations of treason. Leopold, however, 
2 CONT refused to administer his country under German control and was imprisoned 
2 CONT first in his castle at Brussels and later in Germany. Despite his defiance 
2 CONT of the Germans, the Belgian government-in-exile in London refused to 
2 CONT recognize his right to rule. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT After the liberation of Belgium in 1944, the legislature elected Leopold's 
2 CONT brother Prince Charles as regent. Leopold later went into exile in 
2 CONT Switzerland. In 1946 a commission of inquiry exonerated Leopold of 
2 CONT treason, but the controversy concerning his loyalty continued. He won a 
2 CONT referendum permitting his return, and he returned from exile on July 22, 
2 CONT 1950. Riots soon erupted, and on August 1 he delegated his royal powers to 
2 CONT his son Baudouin. On July 16, 1951, Leopold abdicated in favor of 
2 CONT Baudouin.

1 NOTE During his liberal and popular rule, numerous reforms were instituted. The

2 CONT was based on property and earnings). Charles was interested in literature 
2 CONT and the arts and wrote a volume of poems. Having no male heirs, he was

1 NOTE He raised the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. John Sobieski was the son 
2 CONT of a high-ranking member of the Polish senate. He distinguished himself in 
2 CONT the Polish-Swedish war of 1655-60 and against the cossacks and Tatars in 
2 CONT 1667. In 1668 King John II Casimir made him commander in chief of the 
2 CONT Polish army. Sobieski's wife was French, and he assumed leadership of a 
2 CONT pro-French faction among the nobility during the reign (1669-73) of John 
2 CONT Casimir's successor, Michael Wi´niowiecki (1638-73). After winning a 
2 CONT brilliant victory over the Ottoman Turks in 1673 at Khotin (now in 
2 CONT Ukraine), Sobieski was elected king to succeed Michael the following year. 
2 CONT He concluded a truce with the Turks in 1676, but, regarding them as 
2 CONT Poland's most dangerous enemies, he abandoned his alliance with Louis XIV 
2 CONT of France (who was friendly to the Turks) and made a pact with Holy Roman 
2 CONT Emperor Leopold I in 1683 . When a Turkish army laid siege to Vienna, 
2 CONT Leopold's capital, later the same year, Sobieski led a force to the city's 
2 CONT rescue, defeating the besiegers at the Battle of the Kahlenberg in 
2 CONT September. During the next few years he participated in the campaigns that 
2 CONT drove the Turks from Hungarian soil, but failed in his attempt to win 
2 CONT control of the Romanian principalities on the shore of the Black Sea. He 
2 CONT was the last great king of Poland; after his death the country fell 
2 CONT increasingly under Russian influence.

1 NOTE He was called The Young Pretender, The Young Chevalier, and Bonnie Prince 
2 CONT Charlie, claimant to the British throne who led the Scottish Highland army 
2 CONT in the Forty-five Rebellion. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1744, after his father had obtained the support of the French 
2 CONT government for a projected invasion of England, Charles Edward went to 
2 CONT France to assume command of the French expeditionary forces. Unfavorable 
2 CONT weather and the mobilization of a powerful British fleet to oppose the 
2 CONT invasion led to cancellation of the plan by the French government. Charles 
2 CONT Edward persisted in his determination to drive George II from the British 
2 CONT throne, however, and in 1745 he arrived in Scotland, where a number of 
2 CONT Highland clans came to his assistance. He took Edinburgh, defeated a 
2 CONT British force at Prestonpans, and advanced as far south as Derby, England, 
2 CONT before being forced to retreat. In April 1746, however, his forces were 
2 CONT utterly routed at Culloden Moor. He was hunted as a fugitive for more than 
2 CONT five months, but the Highlanders never betrayed him, and he escaped to 
2 CONT France in September 1746. Two years later he was expelled from that 
2 CONT country in accordance with one of the provisions of the second Treaty of 
2 CONT Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), which stipulated that all members of the house of 
2 CONT Stuart were to be driven from France. For a number of years Charles Edward 
2 CONT wandered about Europe. Secretly visiting London in 1750 and in 1754, he 
2 CONT attempted without success on both occasions to win support for his cause. 
2 CONT In 1766, on his father's death, Charles Edward returned to Italy, where he 
2 CONT spent his last years.

1 NOTE In 1700 Frederick allied himself with Russia and Poland in the Great 
2 CONT Northern War against Sweden, but he was soon compelled by Charles XII, 
2 CONT king of Sweden, to withdraw from the conflict and to promise not to 
2 CONT reenter it. After the defeat of Charles at Poltava (now in Ukraine) in 
2 CONT 1709, however, Frederick again declared war on Sweden, subsequently taking 
2 CONT the German duchy of Schleswig and participating with the Poles in the 
2 CONT invasion of the Swedish portion of Pomerania. By treaty in 1720 Frederick 
2 CONT agreed to return to Sweden all conquests made in the war, except for 
2 CONT Schleswig. Among the accomplishments of his reign was the freeing of the 
2 CONT peasants from serfdom in 1702.

1 NOTE He was one of the Pilgrims. He went to America on the Mayflower in 1620 
2 CONT and was a signer of the Mayflower Compact. He was one of the founders of 
2 CONT Plymouth, the first permanent English settlement in New England.  In 1627 
2 CONT or shortly afterward, together with the Plymouth colonist Myles Standish, 
2 CONT he founded Duxbury, where he lived until his death. Alden was active in 
2 CONT the affairs of Plymouth Colony, serving alternately as assistant to the 
2 CONT governor and as deputy from Duxbury. He lived longer than any of the other 
2 CONT signers of the Mayflower Compact. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Alden's fame rests chiefly on the romantic tale written by the American 
2 CONT poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, "The Courtship of Myles Standish" (1858). 
2 CONT In the poem, Alden, deeply in love with Priscilla Mullens, proposes to her 
2 CONT on behalf of his shy friend Standish, whereupon she inquires, "Why don't

1 NOTE When Gustav succeeded his father, the power of the monarchy had been 
2 CONT greatly curtailed, and the national assembly, the Riksdag, was torn by 
2 CONT intense party strife. After failing to reconcile the divided factions, 
2 CONT Gustav decided to regain complete control of the government for the 
2 CONT monarchy. With the help of the army he staged a mock revolt in 1772 and 
2 CONT forced the Riksdag to accept a new constitution that gave him absolute 
2 CONT power. He then instituted a series of financial and judicial reforms to 
2 CONT correct corruption in high office, grant freedom of the press and complete 
2 CONT religious toleration, and enlarge the navy, making it one of the strongest 
2 CONT in Europe. In 1788 he undertook an inconclusive war with Russia that was 
2 CONT marked by treason among the nobility at home and mutiny among his troops. 
2 CONT A Swedish naval victory in 1790, however, destroyed a third of the Russian 
2 CONT fleet and enabled him to end the war on terms favorable to Sweden. While 
2 CONT preparing to intervene in the French Revolution in 1792, Gustav was 
2 CONT assassinated in a plot conceived by hostile nobles. A patron of 
2 CONT literature, art, and science, he founded the Swedish Academy in 1786.

1 NOTE (also Genseric) He was king at the time of their greatest power.  In 429 
2 CONT he led all his people from Spain to Africa. The Roman general in Africa, 
2 CONT Bonifacius (died 432), tried vainly to turn the Vandals back, but was 
2 CONT defeated and forced to flee to Italy. After a triumphant progress across 
2 CONT northern Africa, the Vandals captured Carthage in 439, and Gaiseric made 
2 CONT the city his capital. Vandal fleets raided Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. 
2 CONT In 455 Gaiseric used the death of the Roman emperor Valentinian III as a 
2 CONT pretext for the invasion of Rome. The city was undefended, and the Vandals 
2 CONT entered it peacefully, pillaged it for 14 days, and carried away its 
2 CONT treasures. When he withdrew, Gaiseric took as hostages Valentinian's 
2 CONT widow, the empress Eudoxia, and her two daughters, along with Roman 
2 CONT citizens, who were treated as slaves. He then led his armies eastward, 
2 CONT laying waste to Greece and Dalmatia and threatening Constantinople. Two 
2 CONT major attempts to subdue the Vandals, by the Western Roman emperor 
2 CONT Majorian (reigned 457-61) in 457 and by the Eastern Roman emperor Leo I 
2 CONT (400?-74) in 468, were unsuccessful. The Eastern emperor Zeno was forced 
2 CONT to recognize Gaiseric and make peace with him in 476. Gaiseric was 
2 CONT succeeded by his son Hunneric, under whom the African empire of the 
2 CONT Vandals began to disintegrate.

1 NOTE He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history.  From 
2 CONT 1672 to 1673 he served with distinction under his patron, the duke of 
2 CONT York, later James II, king of England, who commanded the English troops 
2 CONT sent to assist France in a war against the Netherlands. In 1682 Churchill, 
2 CONT then a colonel, was raised to the peerage. During the rebellion of 1685, 
2 CONT which was led by James Scott, duke of Monmouth, Churchill was second in 
2 CONT command of the forces of James II and was made a major general. Later, 
2 CONT fearing that James intended to make Roman Catholicism the state religion 
2 CONT of England, Churchill joined the conspiracy to replace James with the 
2 CONT Dutch prince William of Orange. When William landed in England in 1688, 
2 CONT Churchill was promoted to lieutenant general by James and sent to fight 
2 CONT William, but instead he deserted to the latter. William was crowned king 
2 CONT as William III, and in 1689 he made Churchill a privy councillor and earl 
2 CONT of Marlborough. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1692 and again in 1696 Marlborough was charged with treason because he 
2 CONT corresponded with James, who was then living in exile in France; 
2 CONT Marlborough was not imprisoned, but he lost favor at the royal court. When 
2 CONT James's daughter, Anne, succeeded as queen of England in 1702, Marlborough 
2 CONT regained his position at court. That same year, during the War of the 
2 CONT Spanish Succession, he was commander in chief of the armies of England and 
2 CONT the Netherlands, and he was created 1st duke of Marlborough as a reward 
2 CONT for his brilliant victories over the French. Marlborough's greatest 
2 CONT triumphs were in the battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), and 
2 CONT Oudenarde (1708). 
2 CONT   
2 CONT In 1711 Marlborough was falsely accused of embezzling public funds, 
2 CONT removed as commander in chief, and stripped of the public offices that he 
2 CONT had been given in gratitude for his military exploits. He lived abroad in 
2 CONT self-imposed exile from 1712 to 1714. After the accession of George I as 
2 CONT king of Great Britain, Marlborough returned to England in 1714, and his 
2 CONT military rank was restored to him.

1 NOTE He was an American pioneer and Indian fighter, who played a major part in 
2 CONT the exploration and settlement of Kentucky. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1753 his family settled on the Yadkin River in what is now North 
2 CONT Carolina. In this primitive settlement Boone received some schooling and 
2 CONT became a skillful hunter and trapper. He served with the forces led by the 
2 CONT British general Edward Braddock in the campaign in 1755 against Fort 
2 CONT Duquesne during the French and Indian War. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Subsequently Boone set out to explore and settle the wilderness around the 
2 CONT Kentucky River, making the first of many trips into the region in 1767. 
2 CONT Between 1769 and 1771, on his most important expedition, he explored 
2 CONT eastern Kentucky, following a trail through the Cumberland Gap with five 
2 CONT companions. In 1775, having been engaged as the agent of a Carolina 
2 CONT trading company to establish a road by which colonists could reach 
2 CONT Kentucky and settle there, he built a stockade and fort on the site of 
2 CONT Boonesboro. The first group of settlers crossed the Cumberland Gap to 
2 CONT Boonesboro by the road established by Boone, later called the Wilderness 
2 CONT Road. During the American Revolution the community suffered repeated 
2 CONT Indian attacks, and in 1778 Boone was taken captive by Indian raiders. The 
2 CONT settlement, however, was eventually established as a permanent village. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During the early 1780s Boone was forced to abandon his claims to the land 
2 CONT around Boonesboro because of invalid titles, and he moved to Boone's 
2 CONT Station, Kentucky. He later left Kentucky and from 1788 to 1798 lived near 
2 CONT Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). About 1799 he settled near 
2 CONT Saint Louis, in present-day Missouri, where he remained until his death. 
2 CONT The region was then under the authority of Spain; in 1803 it became United 
2 CONT States territory as part of the Louisiana Purchase, and in 1814 Boone's 
2 CONT claim to the land he occupied was confirmed by the U.S. Congress.

1 NOTE He was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford. Churchill 
2 CONT entered the House of Commons as a Conservative in 1874 and was a passive 
2 CONT member until 1880, when the Conservative defeat roused him to action as 
2 CONT leader of the so-called Fourth party, a small band of independents of the 
2 CONT Conservative and Tory parties. They advocated a progressive program for 
2 CONT the Conservative party known as "Tory democracy." Churchill distinguished 
2 CONT himself as a ready unconventional debater, attracting particular attention 
2 CONT by his criticism of the foreign and domestic policy of Prime Minister 
2 CONT William E. Gladstone. When the Conservatives returned to power in 1885, 
2 CONT Churchill became secretary of state for India. His period of office was 
2 CONT marked by the annexation of Burma. For six months in 1886 he was leader of 
2 CONT the House of Commons and chancellor of the Exchequer, but he resigned 
2 CONT because he opposed increased military expenditures. Thereafter he was 
2 CONT inactive in public life. His son, Sir Winston Churchill, was British prime 
2 CONT minister during and after World War II.

1 NOTE He was Great Britain's greatest 20th-century statesman, best known for his 
2 CONT courageous leadership as prime minister during World War II. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He graduated from the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, but having 
2 CONT served in India and the Sudan he resigned his cavalry commission in 1899 
2 CONT to become a correspondent during the Boer War. A daring escape after he 
2 CONT had been captured made him a national hero, and in 1900 he was elected to 
2 CONT Parliament as a Conservative. Despite his aristocratic background, he 
2 CONT switched in 1904 to the Liberal party. In 1908 he became president of the 
2 CONT Board of Trade in Herbert Henry Asquith's Liberal cabinet. Then, and later 
2 CONT as home secretary (1910-11), he worked for special reform in tandem with 
2 CONT David Lloyd George. As first lord of the admiralty (1911-15), Churchill 
2 CONT was a vigorous modernizer of the navy. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT World War I and the Interwar Period
2 CONT 
2 CONT Churchill's role in World War I was controversial and almost destroyed his 
2 CONT career. Naval problems and his support of the disastrous Gallipoli 
2 CONT campaign forced his resignation from the admiralty. Following service as a 
2 CONT batalion commander in France, he joined Lloyd George's coalition cabinet, 
2 CONT and from 1917 to 1922 he filled several important positions, including 
2 CONT minister of munitions and secretary for war. The collapse of Lloyd George 
2 CONT and the Liberal party in 1922 left Churchill out of Parliament between 
2 CONT 1922 and 1924. Returning in 1924, he became chancellor of the Exchequer in 
2 CONT Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government (1924-29). As such he displayed 
2 CONT his new conservatism by returning Britain to the gold standard and 
2 CONT vigorously condemning the trade unions during the general strike of 1926. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT During the depression years (1929-39) Churchill was denied cabinet office. 
2 CONT Baldwinand later Neville Chamberlain, who dominated the national 
2 CONT government from 1931 to 1940disliked his opposition to self-government 
2 CONT for India and his support of Edward VIII during the abdication crisis of 
2 CONT 1936. His insistence on the need for rearmament and his censure of 
2 CONT Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler at Munich in 1938 also aroused 
2 CONT suspicion. When Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, 
2 CONT however, Churchill's views were finally appreciated, and public opinion 
2 CONT demanded his return to the admiralty. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Churchill as Prime Minister
2 CONT     
2 CONT Churchill succeeded Chamberlain as prime minister on May 10, 1940. During 
2 CONT the dark days of World War II that followed -- Dunkirk, the fall of 
2 CONT France, and the blitz -- Churchill's pugnacity and rousing speeches 
2 CONT rallied the British to continue the fight. He urged his compatriots to 
2 CONT conduct themselves so that, "if the British Empire and its Commonwealth 
2 CONT last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest 
2 CONT hour.'" By successful collaboration with President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
2 CONT he was able to secure military aid and moral support from the United 
2 CONT States. After the Soviet Union and the U.S. entered the war in 1941, 
2 CONT Churchill established close ties with leaders of what he called the "Grand 
2 CONT Alliance." Traveling ceaselessly throughout the war, he did much to 
2 CONT coordinate military strategy and to ensure Hitler's defeat. His 
2 CONT conferences with Roosevelt and Stalin, most notably at Yalta in 1945, also 
2 CONT shaped the map of postwar Europe. By 1945 he was admired throughout the 
2 CONT world, his reputation disguising the fact that Britain's military role had 
2 CONT become secondary. Unappreciative of the popular demands for postwar social 
2 CONT change, however, Churchill was defeated by the Labour party in the 
2 CONT election of 1945. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT Churchill criticized the "welfare state" reforms of Labour under his 
2 CONT successor Clement Attlee. He also warned in his "Iron Curtain" speech in 
2 CONT Fulton, Missouri, in 1946, of the dangers of Soviet expansion. He was 
2 CONT prime minister again from 1951 to 1955, but this time age and poor health 
2 CONT prevented him from providing dynamic leadership. Resigning in 1955, 
2 CONT Churchill devoted his last years to painting and writing.
2 CONT   
2 CONT Churchill was also an able historian. His most famous works are The World 
2 CONT Crisis (4 vol., 1923-29), My Early Life (1930), Marlborough (4 vol., 
2 CONT 1933-38), The Second World War (6 vol., 1948-53), and A History of the 
2 CONT English-Speaking Peoples (4 vol., 1956-58). He received the Nobel Prize 
2 CONT for literature and a knighthood in 1953. 
2 CONT     
2 CONT Assessment
2 CONT 
2 CONT Churchill's death in 1965, like that of Queen Victoria in 1901, marked the 
2 CONT end of an era in British history. Born into a Victorian aristocratic 
2 CONT family, he witnessed and participated in Britain's transformation from 
2 CONT empire to welfare state, and its decline as a world power. His true 
2 CONT importance, however, rests on the fact that by sheer stubborn courage he 
2 CONT led the British people, and with them, the democratic Western world, from 
2 CONT the brink of defeat to a final victory in the greatest conflict the world 
2 CONT has ever seen.

1 NOTE Davis was educated at Transylvania University, Lexington, Kentucky, and at 
2 CONT the U.S. Military Academy. After his graduation in 1828, he saw frontier 
2 CONT service until ill health forced his resignation from the army in 1835. He 
2 CONT was a planter in Mississippi from 1835 to 1845, when he was elected to the 
2 CONT U.S. Congress. In 1846 he resigned his seat in order to serve in the 
2 CONT Mexican War and fought at Monterrey and Buena Vista, where he was wounded. 
2 CONT He was U.S. senator from Mississippi from 1847 to 1851, secretary of war 
2 CONT in the cabinet of President Franklin Pierce from 1853 to 1857, and again 
2 CONT U.S. senator from 1857 to 1861. As a senator he often stated his support 
2 CONT of slavery and of states' rights, and as a cabinet member he influenced 
2 CONT Pierce to sign the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which favored the South and 
2 CONT increased the bitterness of the struggle over slavery. In his second term 
2 CONT as senator he became the acknowledged spokesman for the Southern point of 
2 CONT view. He opposed the idea of secession from the Union, however, as a means 
2 CONT of maintaining the principles of the South. Even after the first steps 
2 CONT toward secession had been taken, he tried to keep the Southern states in 
2 CONT the Union, although not at the expense of their principles. When the state 
2 CONT of Mississippi seceded, he withdrew from the Senate. 
2 CONT   
2 CONT On February 18, 1861, the provisional Congress of the Confederate States 
2 CONT made him provisional president. He was elected to the office by popular 
2 CONT vote the same year for a 6-year term and was inaugurated in Richmond, 
2 CONT Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy, on February 22, 1862. Davis 
2 CONT failed to raise sufficient money to fight the American Civil War and could 
2 CONT not obtain recognition and help for the Confederacy from foreign 
2 CONT governments. He was in constant conflict with extreme exponents of the 
2 CONT doctrine of states' rights, and his attempts to have high military 
2 CONT officers appointed by the president were opposed by the governors of the 
2 CONT states. The judges of state courts constantly interfered in military 
2 CONT matters through judicial decisions. Davis was nevertheless responsible for 
2 CONT the raising of the formidable Confederate armies, the notable appointment 
2 CONT of General Robert E. Lee as commander of the Army of Virginia, and the 
2 CONT encouragement of industrial enterprise throughout the South. His zeal, 
2 CONT energy, and faith in the cause of the South were a source of much of the 
2 CONT tenacity with which the Confederacy fought the Civil War. Even in 1865 
2 CONT Davis still hoped the South would be able to achieve its independence, but 
2 CONT at last he realized defeat was imminent and fled from Richmond. On May 10, 
2 CONT 1865, federal troops captured him at Irwinville, Georgia. From 1865 to 
2 CONT 1867 he was imprisoned at Fortress Monroe, Virginia. Davis was indicted 
2 CONT for treason in 1866 but the next year was released on a bond of $100,000 
2 CONT signed by the American newspaper publisher Horace Greeley and other 
2 CONT influential Northerners. In 1868 the federal government dropped the case 
2 CONT against him. From 1870 to 1878 he engaged in a number of unsuccessful 
2 CONT business enterprises; and from 1878 until his death in New Orleans, on 
2 CONT December 6, 1889, he lived near Biloxi, Mississippi. His grave is in 
2 CONT Richmond, Virginia. He wrote The Rise and Fall of the Confederate 
2 CONT Government (1881).

2 CONT English. Later, when the war began to go against England, he changed 
2 CONT sides, concluded the Treaty of Arras (1435) with Charles VII of France, 
2 CONT and received in return most of the province of Picardy. Philip extended 
2 CONT Burgundian rule in the Netherlands, acquiring Holland, Zeeland, and 
2 CONT Hainaut in 1428; Brabant and Limburg in 1433; and Luxembourg in 1443. In 
2 CONT 1453 he conquered the rebellious towns of Flanders. By 1460 he ruled what 
2 CONT is now Belgium and Luxembourg, together with most of the Netherlands and 
2 CONT large areas of northern and eastern France. Philip's court was the most 
2 CONT brilliant of its time. Known for his lavish entertainments and his 
2 CONT devotion to the rituals of chivalry, he instituted (1430) the Order of the 
2 CONT Golden Fleece, one of Europe's most prestigious knightly brotherhoods. In 
2 CONT 1465 he handed the dukedom over to his son, Charles the Bold.

1 NOTE He was the founder of the second and last ducal house of Burgundy. For his 
2 CONT actions in the Battle of Poitiers (1356), he won the nickname The Bold. He 
2 CONT shared his father's captivity in England, and on returning to France in 
2 CONT 1360 he received the duchy of Touraine. Three years later, after the 
2 CONT death, without heirs, of the duke of Burgundy, Philip renounced Touraine 
2 CONT and received Burgundy from his brother, Charles V of France. Between 1369 
2 CONT and 1373 he fought against the English in Normandy and Poitou, and in 1382 
2 CONT he helped to suppress the revolt of the Flemish towns against their count, 
2 CONT Louis of Male, who was his father-in-law. On the death of his 
2 CONT father-in-law in 1384, Philip inherited Flanders. As one of the regents 
2 CONT for the young Charles VI, king of France, from 1380 until the time when 
2 CONT Charles came of age eight years later, Philip was the virtual ruler of 
2 CONT France. When Charles became insane in 1392, Philip was again appointed 
2 CONT regent for him.
