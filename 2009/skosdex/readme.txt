This is Ruby software designed to run in Jruby. 

It uses Jena, a Java-based RDF toolkit.

$JRUBY_HOME must be set, and included on the $PATH so we have the jruby script executable.

everthing in lib/ must be on the CLASSPATH

http://dist.codehaus.org/jruby/

Everything else should just work. Jena library is in lib/
