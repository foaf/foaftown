This is a Subversion repository for the FOAF project.

Note that we have a CVS repository that has seen a variety of historical use, ... including management of the FOAF spec itself.

There is currently no migration plan.

This SVN is being used for foaftown/ collaborations only, at this stage.

You'll find various things here...
