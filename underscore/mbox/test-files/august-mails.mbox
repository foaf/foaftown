Yes, but Bristol Media can't really be held as a shining example until 
it and/or SWScreen pull their finger out and sort out stuff on their own 
doorstep.  The comments on the blogs following the DTI website highlight 
some things that have been bubbling away on my mind quite a bit 
recently.  Namely the issues of accountability and are (public sector) 
clients able to accurately judge if the result meets their requirements.

Take the Bristol Media website as an example.  The tender docs for this 
*clearly* called for the site to be visible to search engines.  This is 
something it completely and utterly missed.  There is no way to get to 
the directory contents of the site, for instance, without a form 
submission.  Now is this a failure of the company implementing it in not 
following the brief, or is this a failure of the tenderer in checking 
that what they asked for was delivered?

On topic of search, why do so many sites still get this wrong?  Again 
the Bristol Media website doesn't search on company names... try typing 
in the names of some large bristol media agencies in the search box and 
you will be surprised at the results... unless they mention their own 
name in the body text they don't show up.

And as for South West Screen..... try searching their website.... oh? 
you can't find the search? No neither can I.  I don't think there is 
one.  So for all the text size change icons and accessibility statements 
all over the place, it is unusable to even the able-bodied.  I'm not 
making these examples up.  I followed a link from a Bristol Media 
bulletin to the SWScreen site about something that was of interest to 
me.  No joy... broken link... no problem just search for it.... oh, no 
search box.  I nearly cried.  Is this really that difficult?

So many of you will have seen already that bristol media are looking for 
a 'sponsor' for their website:

http://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/articles/2006/7/26/website/

This is to re-do the site and fix some of its existing shortcomings. 
Yet has no budget.  So is it most likely to be handed to a small, 
in-experienced startup with no track record to repeat the same mistakes 
again? Or maybe some experienced companies might do some pro-bono work? 
  Or is that free pitch work?  No cost = no value?  Hrmmm... anyone got 
thoughts on this?  Would the people making the decisions on the client 
side understand these issues?  Would they care?  Hey, I mean... its not 
a film or anything, right?

Cynically yours,
-Matt

"Thank you for your email. Dr Fox will take these issues up with the
Minister concerned at the DTI. I have no idea though whether they will issue
him with copies of the documents you request. "

I don't think it's even that...

I've just finished an 18 month contract with a government agency and the
incompetence of some of their suppliers is unreal but yet they seem to win
work over and over again, and charge outrageous fees for what they do.

One supplier I was dealing with was a two man band that literally couldn't
organise a piss up in a brewery, delivered an app that didn't work properly
with the most awful UI and when we were doing the migration of 10GB+ of data
from one server to another, couldn't understand why we needed a backup and
test plan becuase "there's nothing to go wrong". It beggars belief and
despite the managers in agency knowing how crap they were they stuck with
them on the basis of "it's better the devil you know"

OK then. As seems to be usual, it's "don't attribute to malice what
can be explained by incompetence" :p

Afternoon all!

This is probably going to annoy a lot of you as I am sure this has
been discussed over and over again, but there you go.
I am used to integrating payment service provdiers where payment is
taken on a secure page on the providers' hosting, not on my clients.
This time round, they want to be able to allow customers to store
their credit card details, and when the order goes through will be
processed manually through their PDQ machine.
This is how the current website they are using is doing, although it
doesn't allow for storing, and I am wondering what the best way,
php/MySQL wise would be to go about this.
I now an ssl page will be needed, but any help would be very greatful

Regards,

D

It would be important to check that their merchant account permits  
this. I'm assuming that their account permits internet CNP  
transactions. Aside from it being a really bad idea, a lot of them  
won't allow you to store the numbers. Even if you can, you shouldn't  
keep it on the web server itself: it should be on a different machine  
not directly connected to the internet. It's a minefield I tell you!

First thing I'd do is check that their Merchant account provider will
allow them to do this. I had a client who used carnet and they point
blank refused to let him do this. The last thing you want to do is carry
out the work and then find out that the client is unaware that the
system goes against the T&C's of their Merchant account use.

If anyone's interested - bought 2 desktop PCs today from PC world =
(couldn't wait for Dell end, plus they would probably burst into
flames!!) - they are both the same... Packard Bell 3.0GHz Pentium 4 with =
512RAM - DVD RW - 80GB HD (7200) - XP home.

Didn't get monitors - it came to =A3370 each.

That's quite a good deals isn't it?

Nice case too, with a snazzy blue light behind the power switch.

Clive,

Do you have any control over the [Scanned] that gets appended to the
subject line when you reply? It barfs GMail's (and I suspect other
MUAs') threading.

Ta,

Tim

THis is what I would do:

1. Split the numbers into two parts (numbers and dates or whatever)
2. Save each part to a different sql server running on another machine
that the webserver only has insert rights on.  These servers should
not have a default gateway set and various other security
considerations.
3. Only allow select rights from inside the LAN.

Clive,

Do you have any control over the [Scanned] that gets appended to the

We tendered for this too, and the feedback we got was basically was that 
the winning tender was chosen as they produced nice visuals and 
storyboards.  Which being a board made up of mainly film/tv people makes 
sense.  Once again it comes down to the comments made in the blogs about 
the DTI site -- do the people commissioning public sector sites know 
what they are doing?

Clearly the tender process for public websites doesn't work, otherwise 
we would not end up in messes like this.  So question is, is there a way 
for us to somehow educate the tenderer?  I've had similar discussions 
with a large (big 4) consulting/accounting firm on how to do the same 
for Open Source.... the tenderers do not understand what they are asking 
and so ask the wrong questions.... hence get the wrong answers back.

So back to specifics then.  Bristol Media want a new website.  They 
don't have any budget.  This is the site that is meant to represent and 
promote our industry sector.  Should we just try to convince them to get 
a budget from their funders (SWScreen)?  I would have assumed that they 
would have tried this already?  But if they can't?  What? Petition 
SWScreen directly to give them budget for this? Try and get Bristol 
Media moved out from under SWScreen?  Build it by public subscription?

You need to store the numbers encrypted. Ideally noone on the admin end
should be able to view any card numbers especially all the numbers
stored in the db (hmmmm soon-to-be-ex-employee thinks Select * from
user_card_details and go on a shopping spree, not good, or worse still,
anonymously stick em all on a mailing list and watch the company go down
the pan).

My advice, don't do it, leave it (and any potential lawsuits) to the
professionals, there are plenty of different packages out their that let
you integrate a third party payment gateway into your luverly branded
site and you don't have to deal with currency conversion, tax issues and
a potential security audit from the credit agencies. If they've not done
it up to now, is there a real business case for doing it now and having
to take the responsibility/flak for the can of worms that will
inevitably follow?=20

PKE is the only method of encryption that should be used in a  
scenario like this, i.e. the server can encrypt the credit card data,  
but not decrypt it.
Decryption should be performed on a single, secured machine.

It is my understanding that you would not pass risk-assessment in  
order to store user card details anyway, and would therefore be in  
breach of the merchant agreement as outlined by your bank.

The easiest method is to utilize an online payment gateway that  
provides deferred (card shadowing) or preauth/repeat (verification  
and future payment) billing.

If you encrypt the details using an asymmetric crypto such as PGP/GPG 
then you won't need to store the decryption key on the servers.  Encrypt 
the details then stuff them in a database.  Then when you need to get to 
them, copy/paste the encrypted details returned to you into PGP/GPG 
running on the local desktop and feed in the passphrase and it will 
decrypt it.  Type the details into the POS terminal and then when done 
just close PGP.

This way the details are never stored in plaintext on the server, and 
there is not the private key nor passphrase stored on the server.  Only 
compromise would be if someone stole both the desktop PC with the 
private key on it *and* beat the passphrase out of the owner. (Or read 
it off the post-it note stuck to the monitor.... *sigh*)

"meant to represent and promote our industry sector"

does it really though? I see very little evidence of that, is anyone
really getting any support or value from it. We probably all only know
of it because there was a request to tender for the site that went
about when it first started.

Another problem would be that the account details whereby users could
login and update their credit card details would also need to be well
encrypted. After all if CC details are stored then they're going to
expire at some point and the user will need to amend them.

The main loop hole hear would be that each users account, which could be
cracked/hacked whatever.

Unless you're really up on your PHP , MySQL and Server Security when
running a web application like this then I'd agree with rick and suggest
that the client uses a reliable payment service provider i.e. protx,
worldpay, secpay or something along those lines

If you do want to look into securing PHP applications etc then this is
as good a place as any to start

We had a risk assessment form through a number of years ago from a bank 
and it was about 8-10 statments and you had to tick yes/no.  They were 
so vague as to be useless, such as:

* Does the server have a firewall?
* Is the server secure?

Almost as useless as the website tender doc (yup back to them!) on which 
we had to state that we were in agreement that should we hit granite 
when tunneling that we would take responsibility for the incurred delays 
and costs to the project.  It also detailed what specific parts 
constitute a canal lock gate.... thats what you get for using a model 
form contract from the early 1900's, drawn up for the tender of the 
converstion of London street lighting from gas to electric, for a 
website project.

Actually... While it's on the table does anyone have any  
recommendations for payment gateways..

We are looking to finally upgrade our shop to one that uses web tech  
post 1997 and this is one of the things I need to look into..

Ideally one that is multi currency friendly, allows deferred payments  
so we can only charge once we've shipped etc and set up all these  
things within our own admin system which would mean they provide some  
form of API to connect to rather than the old school "file on their  
server in a frame type" stuff.

Global micropayments via text messages would be a bonus as well.

And we don't need (or want!) to store users card numbers.

Cheers for any tips,

Stef

hmmm....I think Plone is costing me almost exactly that much per year.

if only some bright sparks would write a book on it...

I would use Protx if I were you, if you setup as a reseller you get
commission too!

The integration is simple and effective, if using .Net you only need to pass
a Guid through the querystring making it that much harder to tweak with the
values.

There is one problem as I understand it, with this method in that if the
customers machine with the private key on goes down, i.e. hard disk
failure then none of the encrypted CC detail can be read by anyone ever
again. So I'd certainly suggest making a copy of the customers public
and private Keys to avoid this. Only problem there is that you then have
encrypted data backed up on multiple devices. Que the thief from earlier.

Well exactly... and this is my beef... why would a company want to 
sponsor their website development if they didn't know what exactly they 
were sponsoring.

If fairness there has been some forward movement on this:

http://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/events/

7th Sept 6pm is a 're-launch' party at Goldbrick House.  So hopefully 
the board of Bristol Media will tell us what they are planning for the 
future.

Thanks for all your input. Sounds like storing c c details is best
avoided. How about just storing cust name, adress etc, the asking for
card details on ssl and sending to email. That way they can process
and delete, job done!
Thoughts?

you need to upgrade to version 2.6 - that one even develops itself so you
don't even need to pay those pesky developer wages ;-)

if only some bright sparks would write a book on it...


it would be out of date by the time it's finished - you just need to bribe
people with curry instead :-)

My point entirely. They seem to have made good inroads with the
film/tv community, and ignored digital media largely. I think that is
a major sympton of the problem of chucking film/tv and digital into
one big pot, they are hugely different industries which operate in
very different ways.

The main 2 things I see are that

a) film/tv is a far more mature industry with well established
networks and practices and people who work in that industry are well
aware that networking is their bread and butter.

b) Essentially, making some gross generalisations but then i am a fan
of them, people who work in digital media are geeks who would rather
sit in front of a computer than go and network with random strangers
in real life (most of them do this very well in the 'virtual' world,
second life???) other than the very few sales people.

(sorry i have totally lost track now and so this is probably only half finished)

Ah that old chestnut...

Your point about educating these bodies is a really good one Matt.

If I recall correctly we thought about bidding and then got told that they
wanted to *own* the IPR on the content management system used (which in
fairness might be the reason why the engine used for the BM website was umm
seriously sub-standard?). Being asked for IPR on software that you've
written and also for free pitchwork on jobs are common naive requests
that are inevitable when you don't actually have anyone knowledgeable and
proactive from our industry on the board.

Being represented by a body that actually understood who they were
representing would definitely improve the chances of them understanding what
they were asking for...

I don't know if anyone else has sensed it but there seems to be a bit of a
battle over the interactive ground as well as the broader creative industry
bucket. Plenty of cash flying around and I for one would be interested to
know what's being spent in our names. I'd also be up for doing something to
ensure that this is wisely spent. Hell if it's being mis-spent give it to
Education or the NHS!

Right... which was my comment on getting film people to spec a website. 
  So what should we do?  If digital media needs to be treated separately 
then what do we do?

1) Form another separate group outside SWScreen?
2) Lobby/Petition BM to be moved out from under SWScreen and deal direct 
with SWRDA? (and then have people who only understand old buildings 
commissioning websites ;) )

I am, personally, opposed to fragmenting groups as I think there is one 
group already and we should be able to get that going.  It is already 
started and just needs a push.

Also as Bristol is in the finals for the Digital Challenge and going to 
be the most e-Aware (yadda yadda) city in the country, then maybe moving 
BM (or its next generation) up a level to be a sibling, rather than 
child of SWScreen is a valid route.

Good point.  But then I think digital likes to network too... the 
skillswap sessions are a good example of this, and will be great when 
they get going again.  But yes, if the digital community likes to exist 
in a virtual world, then maybe the website for that virtual world really 
does become even more important as our shopfront.

Out of interest, do SWScreen produce regional showreels/etc of work in 
the region? Who pays for them SWScreen?  Is that not analogous to what 
the BM website *could* be for the digital sector with some funding?

This is something that you could do using something like PGP or GNUPG to
encrypt the email before sending this to a secure mail account. However
you'd still have the same problem of eventually unencrypted CC details
on the customers computer.

Most merchant accounts do come with online payment gateways, I would
suggest that you use one of these. This way you can completely avoid
handling any credit card details at all.

Taking the IPR is standard on every single public sector contract  
we've won.  AFIK, it's a situation created by lawyers to ensure that  
UK.gov is free from punitive licensing in the future, and has  
appropriate rights to modify, reuse, disassemble, etc.

Because it's obviously nonsense, we have a sensible conversation with  
the client about it every time, and it's always relaxed.  We explain  
how *transferring in entirety* the IPR prevents us from trading as a  
business, as we are left with nothing to sell.  Ever Again.  Ever.

We then suggest a 'shared IP' situation and everyone goes home  
happy.  To happy bunny land.

cheers,

andy

There has been a massive decline in interactive members appearing at  
the networking events.  Taking the speed networking as an example, I  
think I've been to all but one (or maybe two if there's been another  
recently).  The first few events were full of useful and varied  
contacts, a couple of which I actually did business with and would  
have not met otherwise.  But each time it's happened the split has  
moved in favor of the TV/Film Industry, to the point where last time  
I went it was pretty much 90/10.  Why is that?  Bristol Media's basic  
advertising isn't targeted at a particular industry which leads me to  
believe that there's either more TV/Film people based here or they're  
more willing to network (for either of Laura's reasons).

I feel a bit sorry for Bristol Media, I remember early emails when  
they were trying to set something up were already pulling it down.   
Forcing a community between disparate groups is a hard job, without  
an organic natural community forming (such as Underscore) my belief  
is it takes a shit load of cash to continually draw people into  
situation over and over again until the human nature takes over.

I'm pretty sure this conversation was had early on when the company  
involved in creating the site posted [_] for comments and suggestions  
of the kind of tools the Bristol Media site should have.  I'm then  
pretty sure this consultation continued and included a number of  
meetings with various members across Bristol.  I can't comment on how  
many of these suggestions got created, and to what quality, but that  
seems like a pretty solid beginnings.  Why haven't (interactive)  
people used it?

It would be a very useful exercise to understand the issues and  
failings in the steps taken so far, both for ourselves and to place  
in front of BM. Especially before calling for a revolution.

Errrr.... you are going to encrypt those credit card details in PGP or

That's not 100% fair on this one - the winning bid was very solid and  
contained a lot of value.  Can't say more unfortunately.  But it was  
a shiny bid.

We are finding the same with local authorities.  They are buying web  
sites and web apps using a procurement process designed for boxed  
software for desktops and terminals.  Sample questions:
- 'how does your product integrate with Active Directory?'
- 'confirm that your application can be deployed on Citrix  
application server'
- 'your application must have no impact on network load'
(these are browser based apps)

but I digress.

<http://www.spark-online.co.uk/> is a subscription thing - have a  
gander.

My 2p: 10p:
- Bristol Media and associated site were shaped by several group  
meetings at Watershed.  It was a remarkably collaborative process for  
a public sector body.  Most of the meetings were open, free (natch)  
and in a reasonably convenient location at a reasonably convenient time.
- Whether it works in practice is obviously a matter of free debate,  
but it was explicitly not imposed from the top down.  Although there  
were politics involved (natch).
- the website brief was above all to create a usable directory  
focussing on making it easy to network, recruit, and find  
employment.  The size of the talent pool is the single biggest issue  
we face, work is as easy to find as it could ever be (my view, feel  
free to throw bricks).  How well does it do this task?
- the wind has gone out of the sails with BM since Claire left, less  
events, less sense of momentum.  Now would be an ideal time to  
address this.
- we examined this before with the short and regular group, which met  
regularly, for a short time...so just a plea to not reinvent wheels?

cheers,

Erm, they would be very happy.

As I understand it - if you do this with a product (e.g. a CMS or a
Consultation system say) then technically you could not resell it
without their permission (nor they without yours). Certainly you could
never offer the shared IPR to anyone else without their consent (and
if you have done this you could be in danger of some major legal
action).

Also if you intend in the future to make a lot of money out of any
product you have given join IPR on you could well end up sharing it.

It really doesn't leave you in any better a situation than you giving
them the IPR, it just leaves them in the same position.

It's a fair point, and I should clarify.  Presumably the CMS would =20
make extensive use of pre-existing IP on the developer side?  These =20
shouldn't be included in any shared IP situation, that would be =20
onerous.  That's your pre-existing IP and is one of your assets.  =20
It's unrealistic for a client to expect IP on that.

For example we built a consultation system that had a nominal cost of =20=

=A340k to us, but licensed it to a client for =A312k.  We retained that =20=

IP, but shared specific IP around the skinning, specific =20
configuration, reporting, management process etc.

That client specified a complete IP transfer, but were eventually =20
convinced by the value argument (and the odd bit of hardball =20
negotiation) to share the IP.  They were open about wanting to own =20
and resell the software, but as you'd expect, they couldn't really =20
advance any kind of compelling argument as to why they should do that =20=

and cause us to make a loss.

If you work jointly with the client to develop some IP, or even if =20
you are retained to solve a problem for them without their help, then =20=

it's a fair argument that you shouldn't be able to resell that =20
without sharing with them, unless you can show some significant =20
discounting on the price they pay versus the value of the asset created.

Anyone want to pick holes in this - it's really useful to get fresh =20
perspectives.  Personally I think we need more peer discussion about =20
business models and tactics, and less flame wars about JS vs. CSS =20
image replacement.  Perhaps I'm in the wrong place though?

cheers,

andy

pfff.  if there *are* any Plone developers lurking out there, send me  
your CV.   or look at <http://teamrubber.com/jobs>.  or maybe don't.   
it's a free world etc.

so, who wants to learn Plone?  (and Zope)

Actually there is very little use business wise in such networking
events for web/interactive. For TV/Film it makes absolute sense, as
they all do business with each other. For us we would be better
spending time networking in a more diverse setting. Unless you are in
the business of making websites for local production/post production
companies there is little business to be had. For meeting with people
in your own industry skillswap is better, but so is having discussions
on underscore.

The thing is, things will be a success if they offer something people
need and want. It needs a business case. Took a bit of work to realise
that for such a thing to be a success in our industry is not easy, and
is certainly hindered when the organisation trying to do it is focused
on a very different industry. But fear not, they have had no problem
securing public funding that is aimed at us, or in spending it.

We are a bloody resourceful and self organising industry - otherwise
we wouldn't be having this conversation right now. I don't see the
need for an organisation to self appoint themselves as representing
our industry. The only thing that annoys me is that there is public
sector funding aimed at promoting and developing our industry. I can
think of a million things to do with that that would really improve
awareness, and facilities for us.

Actually a lot of these things have been provided over the years by
the Watershed, where we had the original [_] meeting. Where they have
provided space for us (as a community) on regular occasions to support
what we as a have chosen to do (for free and out of their own pockets)
- and in initiatives to promote us. They have supported education and
up and coming small businesses, and have worked to relate our industry
to the community around us and promote our local industry in the
national press. They are championing Bristol in the digital challenge!
If anywhere was to be central to us and be a place I would be happy to
see funding for us being spent, it is there.

To have a revolution there needs to be someone to overthrow, I don't
see any leader here. Acquisition of funding does not imply authority.

Yeah, I don't doubt it.  Perl's pretty esoteric at times, and it's a  
lot easier to do a new language right than fix existing bad  
practises.  Also, in my defence, I learnt Perl from a very basic book  
that missed out big topics like CPAN.

As to chocolate covered wafers, if you can suggest a good place to  
get them in Redland at 2315 at night, please do!

The problem is that most small shops would go bust before the tendering 
process had got to best and final offer. Even this pile would have taken 
ages to purchase, let alone build. I spent a year writing a bid for a 
government department. 4 months in workshops doing "requirements 
capture" (in a team of 3 with specialists dropping in an out as we 
needed them) then 2 months writing the bid (15 - 26 people full time) 
then spent  6 months waiting while deadline after deadline slips "We are 
so hopeless at meeting deadlines..." one chap once admitted to me over 
lunch.

The killer is that while all this is going on you are unable to commit  
key resources to other tasks in case the department actually meets its 
commitments and hires you...

The secondly 175K is an amazingly small amount of cash.

When you write any proposal to government 90% of the costs involved are 
based on assumptions made from requirements capture.
Most of that data is completely wrong and then needs re assessing by 
someone that understands the issue instead of the  government bod that  
made a blind statement. Then when you win the bid, the process starts 
from scratch again as what the department actually want will have 
changed. thus My winning bid of 29,000,000 or there abouts was at 
350,000,000... mainly down to changes in specification and customer 
slippage....

Government money looks easy cash but its quite a nasty way to earn a 
living :(

Amen. We have done some large EU-funded projects with government =20
agencies that shall remain nameless, and it was a nightmare. We were =20
the only SME on the project: the rest were universities and govt =20
agencies. Because of this, we seemed to be the only partner who cared =20=

about the fact that we were more than a year late in receiving our =20
first payment. In the meantime it was costing us massive amounts in =20
terms of out of pocket expenses and man hours. Let's not even get =20
into the paperwork that was involved.

Hi

I know some people out there are mostly Mac based - so can you tell me 
how easy it is to set up PHP and Apache on Mac?

I use mac for design and then build sites on windows.

I'm using OSX 10.3.3 - but am thinking about getting a macbook soon.

Cheers

Juan

PHP4 is already set up - nothing to do there, you simply go into  
"system Preferences" -> "Sharing" and turn on "Web Sharing".

A more complete PHP package can be found at http://www.entropy.ch/ 
software/macosx/php/
You simply run the installer, and its done (still need to turn on  
"Web Sharing")

Mind you, if PHP+Apache is all you want (ie not MySQL as well) then
Mac OS X comes with PHP 4 and Apache built in. You need to uncomment
the line in the apache config file that enables mod_php.

MAMP, though, is the way forward if you want php 5.

They're already installed. That said, it's better to use something  
like darwinports or fink, as it allows you to easily add other stuff.  
I do all of my LAMP development on a Macbook, with apache, php5 and  
mysql5 installed via darwinports, and it's fantastic. I used to use  
fink, but found darwinports nicer. Our stuff isn't exactly simple  
either, needing quite a few external libraries and extensions, but it  
all works beautifully. I can use exactly the same setup as we have on  
our Debian deployment server, simply needing to change the root  
directories in our config files.

I am really pleased that this sparked a sensible discussion, as that
was what I hoped would happen. I agree with Dan's points on the speed
networking, and thats why I didnt bother with the last one, I saw
little value in it for me.

I am not suggesting that BM is the be all and end all or that it will
solve any problems or issues, however, as Stuart points out, it IS
using money that is earmarked for interactive/digital (whatever you
want to call it) and people in that industry ARE a target audience.

Regarding Matts point about showreels, I believe that BM wanted to
produce a showreel, but in DVD format, which again lends itself more
toward Film/TV than digital but also that the budget was EXTREMELY
limited, in fact in my humble opinion it would be impossible to
produce something worthwile with the budget they had. Especially as it
was aimed at promoting Bristol on an international platform, I mean it
has to be bloody good if you are going to do that otherwise you just
embarrass yourself.

Regards networking, I thought that perhaps forums of some sort on the
BM site could be of value as 'virtual' networking and that if people
got some kind of intrinsic value from that and enjoyed the discussions
they would be more inclined to attend other 'real life' events.

Basically from my perspective I was really keen to take over from
Claire and had lots of ideas and I 'hope' that you guys know that I am
hugely enthusiastic if a little misguided at times! But more than
willing to take on the views and opinions of the community, however,
the feedback I got was that I was 'too ambitious' and it was 'just a
little part time job' two things which I massively disagree with. I
think its a big job to make BM work effectively and a big task for one
person to take on, and I dont believe there is such a thing a too
ambitious, I am not ambitious for me, but for what could be acheived.
I was a little nervous to write this stuff in a public mailing list,
as I have no idea who is reading it but, its the truth and so there it
is.

TBH those facts have made me a little, whats the word, disillusioned
(?) with BM and made me feel that they dont have a strong idea of what
they want to acheive and are basically happy to tick some boxes for
SWS targets, which annoys me as I still believe there is great
potential for great things.

I would like to find a constructive way to input this groups momentum
into BM and to move things forward in a positive manner. And I think a
bloody cocktail party at GoldBrick House (co-incidentally owned by the
new chair of BM) is a waste of money and could be put to far better
use. It wouldnt be a waste of money if I could see that BM had
acheived something.

As for the pitch and do a free website idea well I (wonder if I should
say this again in a public forum) but I think its a load of shite. We
as an industry are forever bemoaning and trying to get away from doing
free pitch work and to do a free pitch AND free work for an
organisatioin that is spending however much on a bloody cocktail party
IS a load of shite. PRIORITIES!!!!!!!!!! And the intimation that you
will get respect on a national and international level for doing it is
also a load of shite, you sure as hell wont with the way things are
going now.

I'd like to know how many D&AD members have ever heard of Bristol
Media????? Or ad execs you know, the people out there who HAVE the
budgets to commission work from the likes of the people on this list?
I would hazard a guess at VERY FEW IF ANY.

Anyway enough of my ranting, it isnt getting me, you or BM anywhere.

Resigned to it all,

Laura

Hi
    you will find that PHP and apache works out the box on most linux 
distros to. you could run up a VM machine and install linux to try it 
out first...

Good Luck

a good rant, Laura - and I agree with it all.  We have made a decision that
we do no free pitches any more, nor free work.  Nor free consultancy, which
is what some people expect us to be doing.

speaking for myself, I can't see that BM can offer me anything - we're not
doing "sexy" sites, we're not doing Flash, we're a two man^H^H person
company who don't wish to get any bigger ...

mac - I dont see it as about you needing to get any bigger or do flash
or anything, its about, or rather i would like to see it about, you
getting more of the work that you want to do and getting paid more to
do it. And that goes for anyone and everyone.

I would like to see them sponsoring things like SkillSwap (which is
running out of sponsorship) and expanding and doing SkillSwaps for
other industry segments too, I would love to do one every week on
different areas, one for programmers, one for designers, one for film,
for editors, for producers, cameramen, small business ideas etc etc
etc

I see the whole thing as about creating opportunities for people to do
what they want and upskilling the region AND also very importantly
promoting the region and creating opportunities for those in the
region to promote themselves.

Laura

That's sad and unfortunate because part of the original BM debate  
focussed on how to serve a wide spectrum of needs without giving  
special favour to any one sector or size of business.

Promoting (for example) Flash was just never an outcome of the  
discussion, and I find it honestly strange that you would think so;  
it leaves me concerned about how the organisation is perceived.

cheers,

That would be Mike Bennet from E3 then (having just googled GoldBrick
House). I can now understand why Bristol Media is so supporting of the
rest of our industry :) and why the only mention of our industry on
the Bristol Media website is in the last paragraph of the about page
with the line.

"Digital media is booming with around 200 specialised firms and trails
being blazed by the likes of  South Bristol wonder kids E3, fast
becoming European leaders in the digital industry."

So you are a trail blazing European leader E3, or one of many
"specialised firms". Its no wonder SWS think Bristol Media represents
our industry - obviously E3 is our industry.

it wasn't (unusually :) a dig at Flash*, but more a statement of the sort of

another meet would be good, but preferably not in the Watershed [tips hat to

We had several this year, organised by someone who is on the list, (oh
yeah me!) and the next one is September after SkillSwap as usual!
Monday  September 11th ... 6-8 for SkillSwap 8-close [_] meet up.
SubSub are providing beers for SkillSwap, and there will be sandwiches
and cakes.

I see a recurring problem here, but some background first: our  
business cross all of the sectors, e.g. Film, TV (a bit), animation,  
digital media, and occasional print work.  I also engage personally  
with SWS, the RDA, watershed, the universities, and anyone else I can  
get in front of.

The problem is that in trying to engage with the digital media  
community, which I believe is a key emerging sector in the City, very  
few people can articulate coherently:
(i) what the structural problems are for the sector in the region (or  
specifically in Bristol)
(ii) what they would like done about it

But SkillSwap seems to offer genuine value and be well supported.   
This is something we could push if we can show it will
(i) meet a demonstrable need
(ii) be effective and deliver value
(iii) be supported by the industry and not wither on the vine

thoughts, alternative suggestions?

Absolutely I agree 100% and that is why it has been supported thus
far, however there were political and personal reasons why that
support kept being threatened to be withdrawn. And personally I think
it is far better suited to SWS/BM support than its current sponsor.

yep,  after our flurry of "meetings that aren't underscore" the other..
err.. year,  I think we ended up with a list of things that people that
people did and didn't like, but no clear vision of where to go from there
other than to meet up regulalry to discuss things, which petered out pretty
quickly, I think mainly because people were too busy and had too many
commitments to meet up that frequently.

But SkillSwap seems to offer genuine value and be well supported.

yes, skillswap is one thing that has genuine value in our sector and has a
proven model in the original Brighton version, and this is something I would
like to see supported by Bristol Media/SWS.

There's a world of difference between PHP and WebObjects. Maybe they  
could replace Cocoa with Javascript or Carbon with Perl? The WO  
frameworks have far more in common with existing MacOS X development  
technologies than PHP. Even Rails is a closer match to the way most  
Macintosh developers think but it is still very different to  
WebObjects.  I guess that is why Rails will be in Leopard and Apple  
haven't hidden their enthusiasm for Rails. Apple definitely do not  
grip onto WebObjects for dear life. More a love-hate relationship.
WebObjects is a mature, sophisticated and elegant set of frameworks  
that have been around a long time so perhaps it is time for a change  
in direction. Maybe there will be changes soon. Being so mature,  
giant upgrades should not really be expected for WebObjects and it  
doesn't help that many in the WebObjects' team have been working on  
CoreData for the past few years.

Most WO developers now use Eclipse and WOLips rather than Xcode even  
after the inclusion of the new WO tools in Xcode during WWDC 2005.  
The development tools have never been WebObjects' strong point.   
Personally I still use Xcode for WO development just because I find  
it easier to work with just one IDE but will switch to Eclipse in the  
near future. Any Java development in Xcode is definitely a less  
satisfying experience than C, Objective-C or C++ development.

I would like to see something along the lines of the ICA Club (Creative 
Network London), which I think serves as a potentially good model of a 
community representing a broad selection of media industry sectors - 
http://www.ica-theclub.com/about/

Admittedly it helps if you are backed by an organisation with the clout 
of the Institute of the Contemporary Arts and have hefty sponsors like 
Channel Four and the Arts Council behind you, but I guess setting 
something up along these lines effectively is never gonna be cheap.

As to how effective or active the ICA Club is even with this backing I 
wouldn't know - not particularly active I guess judging by how few 
entries there are in the blog - 8 since the sites launch in November..!

One thing I have always found a bit strange about the Bristol Media 
site is the fact that when you view a member's details there is an 
"edit' button at the bottom of the page which seems to suggest  you can 
edit their details - haven't actually tried it to see if it works but 
some malevolent fun could be had there if you were so inclined...!

So it would appear Protx then :-)

It does look good and the stuff to integrate it into your site using  
the Direct method looks like I could get my teeth into something  
pretty slick back-end wise for our accounting and shop people...

Have passed it on to the account dept for the once over...

Cheers for the suggestion everyone..

Rgds, Stef

In theory it would be fairly rapidly undone by the admin who gets  
email notification of changes.  Similar to a wiki model, the idea is  
to make it easy to use first and deal with abuse later, rather than  
being so paranoid about abuse that you design a system that has a  
high barrier to entry and thus doesn't get used.  It will be  
interesting to see if this idea makes it into any redesign of the site.

cheers,

Oh wise ones, I'm setting up some mail aliases via webmin and it  
gives me a number of options for 'Alias destinations' including:
* Email address ...
* Mailbox of user ...

Suppose, for example I have a mail user 'alice' set up to receive her  
mail in her mailbox _and_ to have it forwarded to alice@elsewhere.com.

If I then set up an alias for alice, say 'whiterabbit' does it make  
any difference whether I set the destination as alice's email or  
alice's mailbox?

I'm guessing that if I choose the mailbox option it will go straight  
to her mailbox and not get forwarded elsewhere but if I choose the  
address option it will end up in her mailbox _and_ get forwarded  
elsewhere. Yes?

TIA

Yeah - I knew that PHP and Apache were already on OSX - but I presumed 
they would be out of date simple versions.

I am a designer so can I just ask if this is correct? Are darwinports 
and fink just a way of setting up complied versions PHP etc?

When I installed PHP on my PC I just downloaded the PHP package from 
PHP.net, can I not do that with Mac? I want to keep it as simple as 
possible - just want PHP and Apache so I can  build my sites with PHP?

Excuse my ignorance - I don't even know what LAMP is, but I don't think 
I need to know yet.

The "M" in LAMP, stands for MySQL

If you dont require MySQL, your best bet is to download the PHP  
package from:

http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/

That will work with the OSX apache, so you dont have to worry about  
having extra software "doing stuff" on your machine.

Right - I'm going to have to bow out of this discussion now - cos it's 
going way over my head. I'll do a bit more googling.

But, just so I know... If I do get a macbook, would anyone in bristol be 
prepared to set up PHP and Apache for me (if I don't work it out myself) 
for money?

You set it in the BIOS.

IIRC You press [DEL] as the PC is booting, and it will present you  
with an ugly as sin menu system.

You need to specify the order of boot devices, set it to be:
CD-ROM
ATA
FLOPPY

Or something along those lines (will work as long as CD-ROM is first  
on the list).

Go into the BIOS (usually keep hitting "Del" as soon as you switch the
machine on). Then look for "Boot sequence" options (often in "advanced
settings", and probably you'll find it's using the HDD before the CD-ROM.
Just change the order so the CD comes first.

Ah, now *that* was entertainment. Perhaps someone could get the people
responsible for IE7's CSS implementation over for a drink and a "chat"?
I suspect they're wise to us now, though - ah well :(

Well this is the thing see.... big wads of cash don't mean success. 
Underscore has had no funding, and has no particular aims etc and is 
pretty damn active -- this is the 42'nd post *today*

I've always wanted to keep away from trying to organise anything too big 
for underscore as it ain't broke so don't fix it.  But then Tom is 
right, these are the people who *are* the digital industry and there 
should be a way to 'leverage' (I hate the word too) the momentum here.

There have been several mentions in the past about a search in our 
archives, and Christian has been bugging me about updated templates etc. 
(yes, soon...).  but beyond that?

I think the directory in the BM site is a damn goood start, and if we 
can get a few issues with it sorted out then I think it could be really 
good.. and I think this is one big aspect of what BM can do to support 
the industry.

Underscore, on the other hand has alwats really been about *individuals* 
not companies.  Rick H has mentioned to me several ideas he's had about 
other things Underscore site could offer... and one of those (I may be 
extending, or corruptin Rick's idea... not sure) is to *alongside* the 
mailing list and archives have some kind of 'biography' or 'avatar' or 
similar for each poster.  Anybody who has used the gmane archives for 
mailing lists might have noticed that if it recognises your domain name 
then it will put your company icon up next to the post.

What if we had something similar? Reeeeeeallly simple... but what if 
your underscore email/password allowed you to login to a simple site to 
put in some simple biog info, *including* link to company profile/info 
on the BM site, links, quotes, photo etc... whatever... just a chance to 
put a bit of background about *you* and any companies/organisations you 
are part of or affiliated with.  Many people on Underscore wear several 
hats and I'm sure would be good if could link to each of those.

Then the underscore archives, would look up the posters email address 
and next to each posting would show their icon/photo/avatar, brief 
details and then link to full profile/whatever site you want.

The idea would be to *not* change underscore in any way as it currently 
works, but to just provide some ancilliary information and context.  The 
number of times searching for stuff in google and I've come across 
underscore posts is numerous... now imagine if we augmented that google 
juice with a bit of info about the people behind the posts.  To really 
show the knowledge and experience of the people in the list.

Thoughts?

-Matt

yep my idea was basically that underscore could be extended without being
changed, i.e. to add extra optional facilities that would make the archives
more useful as a website, but with no change to how the list operates, other
than that all underscore members would have the option to log onto the
website with their existing underscore username and password and add stuff
to their own area. By having the user database and archives linked up in
this way we could add some proper searching, plus make it possible for
people to tag posts, subscribe to threads or keyword search results by RSS,
loads of other clever stuff. Wrap all this up in some nice user-contributed
skins and it would be a very nice community website to sit alongside the
list.

I think it wouldnt hurt to do that stuff, I mean how can it, and you
wouldnt *have* to add anything if you didnt want to. But if we
improved the site and made it a little more of a showcasey type thing
and it gets googled then that could really make some impact I believe,
at the very least get people talking about 'that underscore lot in
bristol/bath'.

But, I also think we should make BM work for us, by supporting them
and also influencing them. One thing I was most annoyed about hearing
lately is that the new chair has some 'big ideas' and they are going
to announce them at the swanky cocktail party thing (I think we should
all go btw), personally I would have thought that it would be better
for the new ideas to be announced (especially as they are supposed to
be so radical and bring so much improvement) and a little consultation
take place? Perhaps I am wrong?

Chris Wilson did turn up for the WaSP 'open meeting' at SXSW and did a
session at @media. No real fireworks, I'm afraid. At least, nothing like has
been in the comments on his blog of late <http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/>.

I disagree, profiles are one thing. SkillSwap is another (which I'm all
for on an individual basis) as for Underscore being a collective, it's
not it's a forum, of individuals. Many of whom are actually competitors
at company level. Keep the showcases for the portfolios and company
sites.

I have some inside contacts, I definately think I could get some
interesting people to come and talk about stuff. I had a great idea
for some 'seminars' a while back and had interest from people inside
both apple and M$  along with Adobe, Macromedia (when they werent
adobe) and others. Now, if only I had the time and some funding to
sort it, I wonder what job that would be??? .............

*slaps self very hard*

No, seriously, I'd love to upload a few bits and pieces - if this can be

>>Nothing wrong with a bit of healthy competition and the overall goal
(in my mind) would be to win bigger contracts which require
collaboration.

That's not Underscore IMO, If you're talking about empire building a
small company and freelance network (plenty of those come and gone while
Underscore rumbles on) to *really* go for 'bigger contracts' that's a
completely different beast which would be relevant to only some of
Underscores 'members'. It is also likely to make others uncomfortable
should it be in anyway affiliated with Underscore.

Yes, Claranet had a router on the same mains ring which had to be
powered off, disrupting their entire network earlier today for about
15 minutes.  Its all back up and working now.

*the competition*?

Indeed, I *don't want to duplicate BM* I'll repeat that *I do NOT want 
to duplicate BM*.  The idea was to tie the two together a bit in a very 
lightweight way.  So for instance if you view a post from me in the 
archives then alongside the post will be a paragraph about who I am and 
what I do, and then links to Netsight, BMEX, and Netsight MCC's profiles 
on bristolmedia.co.uk.  Maybe a link to a personal blog if I had one 
etc.  I guess the kind of stuff that would often be in a .sig but 
expanded a bit.

>>Well it was only a thought that it *might* lead to that sort of thing,
I dont think its the point really either. You seem very bothered about
*the competition*?

That's great and I'd wish you the best of luck. I just don't think
Underscore is the correct vehicle.=20

Certainly not bothered by competition (though I can see how it may of
come across like that). I'm all for a thriving industry and with the
amount of work everyone seems to have on at the moment that's where were
at.

This is definitely the way to do things.  No point reinventing the  
wheel, engine, brakes etc.  Just add some energy to link the tool we  
have up, and therefore hopefully allow the natural buzz around  
underscore seep into the other things that could be useful.  Shared  
Calendar: BristolMediaCal? Profiles: Bristol Media?

And on a slightly different, but kind of connected theme, are many  
people using linkedIn? (http://www.linkedin.com/), is there any  
potential collaboration with this kind of social networking thing (or  
any need?!)

Mike I agree with you.  I think that sort of activity is *not* 
underscore.  That sort of bit tender organised bid stuff would best be 
done by another vehicle, Bristol Media perhaps.  But Underscore is still 
used very very much for the small scale informal stuff (I need someone 
to do X tomorrow, Help!).

It wasn't *that* shortly after the MS guy then -- the OP said the MS guy was
pimping IE 4 in '97, at which time Flash was at v 1.0 and still nothing more
than FutureSplash Animator with a (very thin) coat of Macromedia paint.
Generator didn't turn up until 2000.

Regardless, I don't suppose there's video of that one? That would be fun.
:-)

TBH, tho, I'd be more keen on beating up on them for the way they're
wrecking PS & Illustrator by tying it all in with Bridge and lawd knows what
all else.

Given that it's Mailman that underpins the operation of this list, an  
[_]
patch for Mailman, perhaps? It's only Python after all ;)

In the first instance, I'd hope we could do:

- htdig integration so we can search the archives properly,
- a finished skin for the most important pages of the MM interface

Thereafter, perhaps the list subscribers page (currently only visible
by you as list admin) could be enhanced in the limited ways you  
describe?

<http://www.bristolmediacal.co.uk/> was created because I forget to  
go to things and wanted reminding, and some other people agreed.   
(name predates Bristol Media by the way) It needs content, like all  
these things.  We could probably make it open submission if someone  
could figure out how to hack PHPiCalendar.  Currently it's driven by  
an iCal feed from Claire's mac, and Claire is too busy to keep it up  
to date.

I've tried Linkdin and 'the other one' (forget it's name, oh SoFlow,  
I remembered).  Full of wierdo consultants, gurus and chancers as far  
as I can see.  True business trust tends to arrive on a  
recommendation from someone else trusted, not on a cold networking site.

You just want to be able to add a few links to/data from people's
profiles on other services - Flickr, del.icio.us, LinkedIn, last.fm. A
bit of RSS magic a la SuprGlu [1] should suffice...

It's all starting to sound A Bit Web 2.0 (TM), in the nicest possible way :p

Ah, right.

Now that you mention it, I went to some Generator seminar thingy in NYC in

yep agreed - this wouldn't be in competiton with other sites just an
extension of what is already exists with underscore. and this should
definately not be just another directory that has to be maintained! No data
should need to be entered if it exists elsewhere, just a link to it or some
other type of integration - Think mashup (ooh I used my first web
2.0buzzword in a useful way!)

What's the subject of the SkillSwap in September? Looked at the

this, would probably violate De Minimis rules or something anyway.

Not wanting to defend snake-oil salespeople pushing products from  
hell, but personally I'm just not that excited by the idea of  
inviting people to be bristol to be collectively rude to them.   
Wouldn't get me out of the house on a cold November evening.

Colour me weird but the idea seems childish and strange and  
represents everything that stops the mainstream (e.g. public sector  
and parts of the industry in Bristol) engaging with [_].

Why does that matter one tiny bit?  Because [_] is consistently held  
up as an amazing and successful resource and a good way to interface  
with the Bristol digital sector.  But it's also borderline hostile or  
just close minded to all kinds of people.  Not that I'd ever suggest  
[_] should change, tidy up, be presentable, be moderated: it is what  
it is.  But you reap what you sow etc. etc.

Not wanting to defend Tom's words (I'm sure he's plenty capable of doing
that himself) but as I recall, there was - how shall I put it? -  
vigorous
debate at most meetings. Seemed like important stuff was being  
discussed.
Nowadays, it seems we don't question what we do as much - instead, we  
get
skill-swaps to help us do the stuff we do better. The arguments  
certainly
seem tamer. Good thing? Bad thing? I dunno. Different.

It is? By whom? Perhaps it's simply long-lived? Let's not forget that  
the
more corporate-friendly networking efforts have, er, SUNK without a  
trace
as those running them moved on to other things.

For many freelancers on this list, I suspect this is just a  
substitute for
office chatter. And offices have their own intimidating aspects too. It
takes a certain confidence to speak out, wherever you are.

This is very true - certain parts of the industry in Bristol view underscore
as a place for arguing techies and hot air/ chat. Quite rightly so most of
the time, but it is also a very good forum to speak the majority of the
people involved in digital media in Bristol (and Bath). I think there is a
bit on an image problem and it would be nice if the people in the industry
who are either intimdated by underscore or completely dismissive of it (or
both) to at least feel like they could announce stuff, or ask questions on
the list. I'm not implying moderation either, but just wanted to make people
aware that underscore is percieved that way by some (inflential) people in
our own industry.

Being at least a few miles from the person you're speaking to helps ;-)

This is very true, and also a lot of nice people who would contribute
are too scared to cos they think we are all mean swines who will rip

Hi

further to my PHP OSX question.

If I run MAMP in OSX - and then run windows in Parallels, will I be able 
to use IE in windows to view sites I am building on Apache in OSX?

ie. - I want to be able to just use windows to check my CSS in IE PC.

Juan

yes.  Parallels is ace.  Load up on RAM though.  Our developers will

but does parallels have "host-only" networking like vmware? i.e. so you can
work disconnected from the network and have different IP addresses for the
host and the guest machine so they can see each other? Virtual PC doesn't do
this - you have to be connected to a network to view stuff being server from
a local web server on either the guest or the host.

>> Thanks RIck!

Very funny, since when do people go round wearing shoes on both  
hands... I must admit though does look rather odd.  I think I must  
have my hands in my coat or a scarf around them?

It is quite strange to see this! It was many many moons ago!

How about I turn up to the next skillswap just to prove I have arms  
that really are quite normal ; )
