[19:47]  <nyergler> nkinkade: are we still requiring email confirmation for wiki edits? (don't want to change, just can't remember)
[19:47]  <nkinkade> nyergler: I'll have to check.  I have this vague recollection that we removed that and were going to play it by ear.
[19:47]  <nkinkade> One sec., someones at the door.
[19:47]  <nyergler> ok

[20:26]  <danbri> hi nyergler, thanks, i'd love to know too
[20:26]  <nyergler> danbri: yup, that's why i'm checking :)
[20:26]  <danbri> :)
[20:26]  <danbri> esp. curious whether email signups are enough to keep the devils away
[20:27]  <nyergler> danbri: i can tell you they're not, at least not fully
[20:27]  <danbri> oh and a privacy question; if someone comes along to cc wiki and makes an openid-facilitated comment, do you consider that a matter of public record (ie. you could expose the openid as data at some point...)
[20:27]  <danbri> not = not enough protection...? or not yet using email much
[20:28]  <nyergler> not enough protection; i'm thinking that we turned off the email confirmation requirement because
[20:28]  <nyergler> a) it was causing lots of emails to the effect of, "why can't i edit?"
[20:28]  <danbri> oof
[20:28]  <nyergler> b) it wasn't eliminating spam
[20:28]  <nyergler> :/
[20:28]  <danbri> so i somehow missed a load of new spam, it was not showing in the default 'recent edits' view
[20:29]  <nyergler> weird; does that view exclude "minor edits" by default?
[20:29]  <danbri> probably i should grep sql dumps for 'viagra' next time, or something low-level like that
[20:29]  <danbri> maybe, or they were talk pages perhaps
[20:29]  <danbri> we didn't do a lot of forensics beyond rescue/repair
[20:29]  <nyergler> right
[20:30]  <danbri> by we I mean Libby Miller who did the rescuing bit; i'm more trying to figure out how to keep it both open and safe... tough one :/
[20:30]  <nyergler> we're saved at the moment by having one volunteer who does a great job watching things
[20:30]  <danbri> ah, lucky
[20:30]  <nyergler> right
[20:30]  <nyergler> yes, quite
[20:30]  <nyergler> nkinkade: what's the extension we turned on for Jesse in the CC wiki?


[20:31]  <nyergler> oh, right, AbuseFilter
[20:31]  <nyergler> danbri: you might want to check out AbuseFilter; our volunteer requested it, and i think it's helped keep things down quite a bit
[20:32]  <danbri> thanks, i'll take a look
[20:32]  <nyergler> also might be interesting to take that into account for the openid data sharing idea; i'll follow-up on the thread shortly
[20:32]  <danbri> i had capcha and blacklist, and felt i was doing enough but it's an arms war...
[20:32]  <danbri> thanks, would love to hear your view
[20:32]  <danbri> it's not a magic cure-all but if a few sites started, could be an interesting experiment at least
