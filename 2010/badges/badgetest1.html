<h1>Badges, Groups and Lists</h1>

<p>
This page describes some badges<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdZKCh6RsU">...</a> - it is a work-in-progress towards
expressing information about groups and lists and badges in RDFa/FOAF. 
</p>

<p>
See also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Userboxes">wikipedia:Userboxes</a> 
and associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Userboxes/Gallery">gallery</a>.
</p>

<p>
The approach explored here is that each page defines a group of people who
are a subset of the group of all people. By providing a unified representation
for making claims about these groups, we open up the data for re-use.
</p>

<p>
Often Wikipedia badges have associated parameters. You might have a badge
indicating that you're in a group who like a particular food; who are interested
in a certain kind of thing; who are fond of some specific animal, etc.
</p>


<dl>
<dt>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Catscratches">Template:Catscratches</a>
</dt>
<dd>This user has been scratched several times by their pet cat.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here's the wikipedia definition,
<pre>
{{userbox
| border-c = #85C8F2
| id       = [[Image:Cat03.jpg|50px]]
| id-c     = white
| info     = This user has been scratched several times by their pet cat.
| info-c   = blue
| info-fc  = {{{info-fc|white}}}
| info-s   = {{{info-s|8}}}
| usercategory  = 
| nocat = {{{nocat|}}}
}}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The Wikipedia badges for human language are amongst the most generative, ie. there 
is an underlying system that sits behind each specific template. For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
So, for example, {{Babel|en|de-1}} would indicate a native speaker of English with basic knowledge of German. {{Babel|en-5|sv|no-4|he-3|lt-2|es-1|an-0}} would indicate a professional proficiency of the English language, a native speaker of Swedish with an almost-native knowledge of Norwegian, advanced knowledge of Hebrew, an intermediate knowledge of Lithuanian, a basic knowledge of Spanish and no knowledge of Aragonese.
</blockquote>

<p>
So we can combine "xx-1 for basic ability - enough to understand written material or simple questions in this language."
 with a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_language_wikis_available">language code</a> to create a specific language ability code.
</p>

<p>
For example: the Wikipedia code for the Croatian language is 'hr', and basic ability is '-1', so 
basic Croatian language ability is hr-1. 
</p>

<h4>Enumerations</h4>	
<p>Other systems have simple enumerated lists, for example <a href="http://www.nanpalmero.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/list-of-foursquare-badges.pdf">foursquare</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>foursquare example: 66, "Boxee Fan", "You took the L train to Brooklyn to attend a software party! Pretty hardcore. venue &amp; date specific
"</li>
<li>foursquare example: 73, Jetsetter, "Hopping around the world one airport at a time... congrats on your 5th airport checkin 
and safe travels!"</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4>Formalising</h4>

<p>What do all these systems have in common?</p>

<p>
They declare <em>groups</em> (lets say of people; we could also treat 
non-human agents, organizations, groups etc. in a similar way, but simply for now). 
</p>
<p>
The give a short natural language description characterising that group. They
may also have a short name, an image link. And in many cases they may be part of
a more complex system defining groups of groups.
</p>

<p>
Consider a Boxee Fan with basic knowledge of Croatian.</p>

<p>
In foursquare, this person would be in group 66 by virtue of having 
checked in at a Boxee.tv promotional event. This means that the group membership is 
asserted by the foursquare service, rather than the user.
</p>

<p>In Wikipedia, the language ability could be encoded as part of a larger 'Babel' template.</p>

<p>The wikipedia markup {{Babel|en|hr-1}} gives rise to HTML markup showing:</p>
<ul>
<li>en - This user is a native speaker of English.</li>
<li>hr-1 - Ovaj suradnik posjeduje osnovno znanje hrvatskog jezika.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So again, we have simple local-to-some-site codes for groups; just as our user is 
in group '66' on foursquare, they're in groups (let's say) "babel en" and "babel hr-1"
on Wikipedia. Unlike foursquare, these group membership claims are typically
asserted by the user, but are accessible for anyone in the wiki to edit.
</p>

<p>
Mailing list membership, or groups in <a href="identi.ca">identi.ca</a> (statusnet) or <a href="http://support.twitter.com/entries/76460-how-to-use-twitter-lists">Twitter lists</a>
can also be looked at this way. Again, they select some but not (usually) all people
and put them in a named group; in some cases (identi.ca) the groups are 
self-selecting; in others (twitter) they are annotations applied by others. On
twitter for example, each user account can create named lists with short names
like 'semweb' to apply to other users. 
</p>
 
<p>Is there an underlying model?</p>

<ul>
<li>groups, lists and badges require a <em>claims-based</em> perspective: some party is asserting that some (typically other) party is a member of some group</li>
<li>Each group typically is defined within a Web page, with label, description, icon etc.</li>
<li>Different sites provide different mechanisms for asserting group membership, and different APIs to the resulting data</li>
<li>The various specific groups used in an assertion often have rich relationships to each other (eg. compare 'en-1' with 'en-5', or the cluster of cat-related groups defined at Wikipedia)</li>
<li>To varying degrees, it may be possible to make template-ized claims about members of some group in machine-friendly form.
 <ul>
  <li>if person x is in this group, they work (or have worked) for organization y</li>
  <li>if person x is in this group, they speak read or write language y, with ability z</li>
  <li>if person x is in this group, they are interested in entity y</li>
  <li>if person x is in this group, they are interested in topic y</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's define some groups. We'll do it all within this page for now, but the
idea is that markup on the foursquare or wikipedia or identica or twitter sites 
would be doing likewise, and that common hidden markup could give shared
structure highlighting what these sites are all doing in common.
