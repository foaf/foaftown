<h1>Lqraps!</h1>

<p>
Lqraps is backwards SPARQL. W3C's SPARQL lets you get a table of 
variable/value bindings by asking questions of a collection of RDF 
graphs. Lqraps does the reverse: by annotating a tabular resultset, and 
rebinding the results to fragments of RDF (specified using SPARQL's 
CONSTRUCT notation) you can generate RDF.
</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> 
Rough cut only. Sketch of what we could do here.
</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>
The original idea here stems from an observation of R.V.Guha's, in the 
QL'1998 paper, "<a 
href="http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/pp/enabling.html">Enabling 
Inference</a>". Discussing a simple RDF query proposal:
</p>
<blockquote>
The query is itself simply an RDF model (i.e., a directed labelled 
graph), some of whose resources and properties may represent variables. 
There are two outputs to every query,

   1. A subgraph (of the KB against which the query is issued) which 
matches the query.
   2. A table of sets of legal bindings for the variables, i.e., when 
these bindings are applied to the variables in the query, we get (1). 
</blockquote>

<p>
In the years following, W3C has standardised the SPARQL query language 
for RDF. It differs from the original Guha et al. proposal in several 
ways. In addition to the GRAPH keyword, which doesn't impact upon 
Lqraps' design, SPARQL queries can contain optionals, filters, and can 
use DESCRIBE and ASK query forms. As such, a raw unconstrained SPARQL 
query can have various features that make it ill-suited to 
data-reconstruction by variable rebinding. However SPARQL also provides 
for the <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#constructGraph">CONSTRUCT</a> 
query form, which is explicitly designed for generating RDF from a set 
of bindings.

(see <a href="people.lq">people.lq</a>; tab formatting may not show 
correctly here)

<h3>Sample implementation</h3>

<pre>
./people.lq > test.n3 

rapper -i turtle test.n3 

[pocky]$ roqet -s test.n3 blood.rq 
roqet: Querying from file blood.rq
roqet: Query has a variable bindings result
result: [url=uri&lt;http://example.org/alice/&gt;, name=string("Alice 
Exemplar")]
roqet: Query returned 1 results
</pre>

<h3>Design Issues and Implementation</h3>

<p>The toy Ruby implementation here expects a tab separate file only. 
Clearly we should extend this to allow comma separated, quote delimited 
etc., and find common ground across the various existing CSV/tab-etc 
parsers.</p>
<p>
RDF (and hence SPARQL) makes some distinctions that are rarely explicit 
in tabular data. Language tagging of literals, datatyping, and most 
critically the distinction between literal and non-literal resources.
This last distinction is the most urgent to handle well; here, I handle 
it badly. Unless a value begins 'http:/', it becomes a plain literal 
with no language tag. The desire here is to allow reasonable RDF 
expressivity while still keeping the inline annotations pretty simple. 
For a more full-featured approach, see the tools and languages around 
SQL/RDF mappings (D2RQ, SquirrelRDF, Virtuoso etc).

<p>
Embedding an Lqraps-style CONSTRUCT in SPARQL result set formats (JSON, 
XML) is left as an exercise for readers...
