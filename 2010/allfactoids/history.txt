Hype

Interest in RDFWeb is totally premature. Our prototype implementations are incomplete, and we've not finished designing the tatoos. Go away!

T-shirts, however, are available. Various people who were represented in RDFWeb at the end of April 2001 feature in the first RDFWeb T-Shirt design. 18 were made and distributed.
