Suggested repository structure
------------------------------

* Put data importing subprojects under import/, eg. import/flickr, import/livejournal 

* Mailing lists can consist of two different types of import:
  - import of existing archives (import/underscore/mbox) 
  - and on-the-fly import (import/underscore/incoming)

* Add other top-level projects as needed.

Since the Underscore importer is just a snippet of code (at the moment) I've eschewed the recommended branches|tags|trunk tree.
